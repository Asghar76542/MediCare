Watch it together with the written tutorial to deepen your understanding: **Manipulating ZIP Files With Python**\\n\\nPython’s `zipfile` module allows you to efficiently manipulate ZIP files, a standard format for compressing and archiving data. With this module, you can create, read, write, extract, and list files within ZIP archives.\\n\\n**By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:**\\n\\nThis tutorial teaches you how to handle ZIP files using Python’s `zipfile`, making file management and data exchange over networks more efficient.\\nUnderstanding these concepts will enhance your ability to work with compressed files in Python, optimizing both data storage and transfer.\\n\\nTo get the most out of this tutorial, you should know the basics of working with files, using the `with` statement, handling file system paths with `pathlib`, and working with classes and object-oriented programming.To get the files and archives that you’ll use to code the examples in this tutorial, click the link below:\\n\\n**Get Materials:** Click here to get a copy of the files and archives that you’ll use to run the examples in this zipfile tutorial.\\n\\n**ZIP files** are a well-known and popular tool in today’s digital world. These files are fairly popular and widely used for cross-platform data exchange over computer networks, notably the Internet.\\n\\nYou can use ZIP files for bundling regular files together into a single archive, compressing your data to save some disk space, distributing your digital products, and more. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to manipulate ZIP files using Python’s `zipfile` module.\\n\\nBecause the terminology around ZIP files can be confusing at times, this tutorial will stick to the following conventions regarding terminology:\\n\\nHaving these terms clear in your mind will help you avoid confusion while you read through the upcoming sections. Now you’re ready to continue learning how to manipulate ZIP files efficiently in your Python code!You’ve probably already encountered and worked with ZIP files. Yes, those with the `.zip` file extension are everywhere! ZIP files, also known as **ZIP archives**, are files that use the **ZIP file format**.\\n\\nPKWARE is the company that created and first implemented this file format. The company put together and maintains the current format specification, which is publicly available and allows the creation of products, programs, and processes that read and write files using the ZIP file format.\\n\\nThe ZIP file format is a cross-platform, interoperable file storage and transfer format. It combines lossless data compression, file management, and data encryption.\\n\\nData compression isn’t a requirement for an archive to be considered a ZIP file. So you can have compressed or uncompressed member files in your ZIP archives. The ZIP file format supports several compression algorithms, though Deflate is the most common. The format also supports information integrity checks with CRC32.\\n\\nEven though there are other similar archiving formats, such as RAR) and TAR#File_format) files, the ZIP file format has quickly become a common standard for efficient data storage and for data exchange over computer networks.ZIP files are everywhere. For example, office suites such as Microsoft Office and Libre Office rely on the ZIP file format as their document container file. This means that `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, and `.odp` files are actually ZIP archives containing several files and folders that make up each document. Other common files that use the ZIP format include `.jar`), `.war`), and `.epub` files.\\n\\nYou may be familiar with GitHub, which provides web hosting for software development and version control using Git. GitHub uses ZIP files to package software projects when you download them to your local computer. For example, you can download the exercise solutions for _Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3_ book in a ZIP file, or you can download any other project of your choice.\\n\\nZIP files allow you to aggregate, compress, and encrypt files into a single interoperable and portable container. You can stream ZIP files, split them into segments, make them self-extracting, and more.Knowing how to create, read, write, and extract ZIP files can be a useful skill for developers and professionals who work with computers and digital information. Among other benefits, ZIP files allow you to:\\n\\nThese features make ZIP files a useful addition to your Python toolbox if you’re looking for a flexible, portable, and reliable way to archive your digital files.\\n\\nYes! Python has several tools that allow you to manipulate ZIP files. Some of these tools are available in the Python standard library. They include low-level libraries for compressing and decompressing data using specific compression algorithms, such as `zlib`, `bz2`, `lzma`, and others.\\n\\nPython also provides a high-level module called `zipfile` specifically designed to create, read, write, extract, and list the content of ZIP files. In this tutorial, you’ll learn about Python’s `zipfile` and how to use it effectively.\\n\\nPython’s `zipfile` provides convenient classes and functions that allow you to create, read, write, extract, and list the content of your ZIP files. Here are some additional features that `zipfile` supports:Be aware that `zipfile` does have a few limitations. For example, the current data decryption feature can be pretty slow because it uses pure Python code. The module can’t handle the creation of encrypted ZIP files. Finally, the use of multi-disk ZIP files isn’t supported either. Despite these limitations, `zipfile` is still a great and useful tool. Keep reading to explore its capabilities.\\n\\nIn the `zipfile` module, you’ll find the `ZipFile` class. This class works pretty much like Python’s built-in `open()` function, allowing you to open your ZIP files using different modes. The read mode ( `\\\"r\\\"`) is the default. You can also use the write ( `\\\"w\\\"`), append ( `\\\"a\\\"`), and exclusive ( `\\\"x\\\"`) modes. You’ll learn more about each of these in a moment.\\n\\n`ZipFile` implements the **context manager protocol** so that you can use the class in a `with` statement. This feature allows you to quickly open and work with a ZIP file without worrying about closing the file after you finish your work.\\n\\nBefore writing any code, make sure you have a copy of the files and archives that you’ll be using:**Get Materials:** Click here to get a copy of the files and archives that you’ll use to run the examples in this zipfile tutorial.\\n\\nTo get your working environment ready, place the downloaded resources into a directory called `python-zipfile/` in your home folder. Once you have the files in the right place, move to the newly created directory and fire up a Python interactive session there.\\n\\nTo warm up, you’ll start by reading the ZIP file called `sample.zip`. To do that, you can use `ZipFile` in reading mode:\\n\\nThe first argument to the initializer of `ZipFile` can be a string representing the path to the ZIP file that you need to open. This argument can accept file-like and path-like objects too. In this example, you use a string-based path.\\n\\nThe second argument to `ZipFile` is a single-letter string representing the mode that you’ll use to open the file. As you learned at the beginning of this section, `ZipFile` can accept four possible modes, depending on your needs. The `mode` positional argument defaults to `\\\"r\\\"`, so you can get rid of it if you want to open the archive for reading only.Inside the `with` statement, you call `.printdir()` on `archive`. The `archive` variable now holds the instance of `ZipFile` itself. This function provides a quick way to display the content of the underlying ZIP file on your screen. The function’s output has a user-friendly tabular format with three informative columns:\\n\\nIf you want to make sure that you’re targeting a valid ZIP file before you try to open it, then you can wrap `ZipFile` in a `try` … `except` statement and catch any `BadZipFile` exception:\\n\\nThe first example successfully opens `sample.zip` without raising a `BadZipFile` exception. That’s because `sample.zip` has a valid ZIP format. On the other hand, the second example doesn’t succeed in opening `bad_sample.zip`, because the file is not a valid ZIP file.\\n\\nTo check for a valid ZIP file, you can also use the `is_zipfile()` function:\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/zip-file\",\n    \"query\": \"python zipfile module tutorial with logging and error handling\",\n    \"content\": \"Failed to get the website\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html\",\n    \"query\": \"python logging cookbook examples for file processing scripts\",\n    \"content\": \"Logging HOWTO\\n\\nRegular Expression HOWTO\\n\\nVinay Sajip <vinay\\\\_sajip at red-dove dot com>\\n\\nThis page contains a number of recipes related to logging, which have been found\\nuseful in the past. For links to tutorial and reference information, please see\\nOther resources.\\n\\nMultiple calls to `logging.getLogger('someLogger')` return a reference to the\\nsame logger object. This is true not only within the same module, but also\\nacross modules as long as it is in the same Python interpreter process. It is\\ntrue for references to the same object; additionally, application code can\\ndefine and configure a parent logger in one module and create (but not\\nconfigure) a child logger in a separate module, and all logger calls to the\\nchild will pass up to the parent. Here is a main module:\\n\\nHere is the auxiliary module:\\n\\nThe output looks like this:\\n\\nLogging from multiple threads requires no special effort. The following example\\nshows logging from the main (initial) thread and another thread:\\n\\nWhen run, the script should print something like the following:This shows the logging output interspersed as one might expect. This approach\\nworks for more threads than shown here, of course.\\n\\nLoggers are plain Python objects. The `addHandler()` method has no\\nminimum or maximum quota for the number of handlers you may add. Sometimes it\\nwill be beneficial for an application to log all messages of all severities to a\\ntext file while simultaneously logging errors or above to the console. To set\\nthis up, simply configure the appropriate handlers. The logging calls in the\\napplication code will remain unchanged. Here is a slight modification to the\\nprevious simple module-based configuration example:\\n\\nNotice that the ‘application’ code does not care about multiple handlers. All\\nthat changed was the addition and configuration of a new handler named _fh_.The ability to create new handlers with higher- or lower-severity filters can be\\nvery helpful when writing and testing an application. Instead of using many\\n`print` statements for debugging, use `logger.debug`: Unlike the print\\nstatements, which you will have to delete or comment out later, the logger.debug\\nstatements can remain intact in the source code and remain dormant until you\\nneed them again. At that time, the only change that needs to happen is to\\nmodify the severity level of the logger and/or handler to debug.\\n\\nLet’s say you want to log to console and file with different message formats and\\nin differing circumstances. Say you want to log messages with levels of DEBUG\\nand higher to file, and those messages at level INFO and higher to the console.\\nLet’s also assume that the file should contain timestamps, but the console\\nmessages should not. Here’s how you can achieve this:\\n\\nWhen you run this, on the console you will see\\n\\nand in the file you will see something like\\n\\nAs you can see, the DEBUG message only shows up in the file. The other messages\\nare sent to both destinations.This example uses console and file handlers, but you can use any number and\\ncombination of handlers you choose.\\n\\nNote that the above choice of log filename `/tmp/myapp.log` implies use of a\\nstandard location for temporary files on POSIX systems. On Windows, you may need to\\nchoose a different directory name for the log - just ensure that the directory exists\\nand that you have the permissions to create and update files in it.\\n\\nSometimes, you might want to do something slightly different from the standard\\nhandling of levels in handlers, where all levels above a threshold get\\nprocessed by a handler. To do this, you need to use filters. Let’s look at a\\nscenario where you want to arrange things as follows:\\n\\nSend messages of severity `INFO` and `WARNING` to `sys.stdout`\\n\\nSend messages of severity `ERROR` and above to `sys.stderr`\\n\\nSend messages of severity `DEBUG` and above to file `app.log`\\n\\nSuppose you configure logging with the following JSON:This configuration does _almost_ what we want, except that `sys.stdout` would show messages\\nof severity `ERROR` and only events of this severity and higher will be tracked\\nas well as `INFO` and `WARNING` messages. To prevent this, we can set up a filter which\\nexcludes those messages and add it to the relevant handler. This can be configured by\\nadding a `filters` section parallel to `formatters` and `handlers`:\\n\\nand changing the section on the `stdout` handler to add it:\\n\\nA filter is just a function, so we can define the `filter_maker` (a factory\\nfunction) as follows:\\n\\nThis converts the string argument passed in to a numeric level, and returns a\\nfunction which only returns `True` if the level of the passed in record is\\nat or below the specified level. Note that in this example I have defined the\\n`filter_maker` in a test script `main.py` that I run from the command line,\\nso its module will be `__main__` \\\\- hence the `__main__.filter_maker` in the\\nfilter configuration. You will need to change that if you define it in a\\ndifferent module.With the filter added, we can run `main.py`, which in full is:\\n\\nAnd after running it like this:\\n\\nWe can see the results are as expected:\\n\\nHere is an example of a module using the logging configuration server:\\n\\nAnd here is a script that takes a filename and sends that file to the server,\\nproperly preceded with the binary-encoded length, as the new logging\\nconfiguration:\\n\\nSometimes you have to get your logging handlers to do their work without\\nblocking the thread you’re logging from. This is common in web applications,\\nthough of course it also occurs in other scenarios.\\n\\nA common culprit which demonstrates sluggish behaviour is the\\n`SMTPHandler`: sending emails can take a long time, for a\\nnumber of reasons outside the developer’s control (for example, a poorly\\nperforming mail or network infrastructure). But almost any network-based\\nhandler can block: Even a `SocketHandler` operation may do a\\nDNS query under the hood which is too slow (and this query can be deep in the\\nsocket library code, below the Python layer, and outside your control).One solution is to use a two-part approach. For the first part, attach only a\\n`QueueHandler` to those loggers which are accessed from\\nperformance-critical threads. They simply write to their queue, which can be\\nsized to a large enough capacity or initialized with no upper bound to their\\nsize. The write to the queue will typically be accepted quickly, though you\\nwill probably need to catch the `queue.Full` exception as a precaution\\nin your code. If you are a library developer who has performance-critical\\nthreads in their code, be sure to document this (together with a suggestion to\\nattach only `QueueHandlers` to your loggers) for the benefit of other\\ndevelopers who will use your code.\\n\\nThe second part of the solution is `QueueListener`, which has been\\ndesigned as the counterpart to `QueueHandler`. A\\n`QueueListener` is very simple: it’s passed a queue and some handlers,\\nand it fires up an internal thread which listens to its queue for LogRecords\\nsent from `QueueHandlers` (or any other source of `LogRecords`, for that\\nmatter). The `LogRecords` are removed from the queue and passed to the\\nhandlers for processing.The advantage of having a separate `QueueListener` class is that you\\ncan use the same instance to service multiple `QueueHandlers`. This is more\\nresource-friendly than, say, having threaded versions of the existing handler\\nclasses, which would eat up one thread per handler for no particular benefit.\\n\\nAn example of using these two classes follows (imports omitted):\\n\\nwhich, when run, will produce:\\n\\nNote\\n\\nAlthough the earlier discussion wasn’t specifically talking about\\nasync code, but rather about slow logging handlers, it should be noted that\\nwhen logging from async code, network and even file handlers could lead to\\nproblems (blocking the event loop) because some logging is done from\\n`asyncio` internals. It might be best, if any async code is used in an\\napplication, to use the above approach for logging, so that any blocking code\\nruns only in the `QueueListener` thread.Changed in version 3.5: Prior to Python 3.5, the `QueueListener` always passed every message\\nreceived from the queue to every handler it was initialized with. (This was\\nbecause it was assumed that level filtering was all done on the other side,\\nwhere the queue is filled.) From 3.5 onwards, this behaviour can be changed\\nby passing a keyword argument `respect_handler_level=True` to the\\nlistener’s constructor. When this is done, the listener compares the level\\nof each message with the handler’s level, and only passes a message to a\\nhandler if it’s appropriate to do so.\\n\\nLet’s say you want to send logging events across a network, and handle them at\\nthe receiving end. A simple way of doing this is attaching a\\n`SocketHandler` instance to the root logger at the sending end:\\n\\nAt the receiving end, you can set up a receiver using the `socketserver`\\nmodule. Here is a basic working example:\\n\\nFirst run the server, and then the client. On the client side, nothing is\\nprinted on the console; on the server side, you should see something like:\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The Real Python article provided a good overview of the `zipfile` module and basic error handling with `try/except` and `ZipFile.is_zipfile()`.

This data may be held on a number of clinical and non-clinical systems, brought together as a patient’s digital record, or electronic patient record (EPR). The digital data will include documents, e.g. ‘legacy’ case-notes and contemporaneous (aka ‘day-forward’) documents generated during or after an episode of care.\\n\\nThere is a need to ensure that documents that form part of a digital record are appropriately indexed to ensure the safe and effective retrieval of documents within a care setting and transfer of these documents across care settings. Therefore, there is a need for national guidance on the naming of digital documents.As an interim step to full digital patient records, some trusts are bulk scanning paper case notes. An agreed process for the bulk-scanning of paper case-notes is also needed to prevent the current situation in some trusts where, it has been reported, all the paper case-notes are being scanned into a single PDF file which is impossible to navigate safely and quickly.\\n\\nNational guidance needs to be endorsed as ‘fit for purpose’ by the end users, e.g.\\n\\nclinicians, patients and document managers in the NHS.\\n\\nThere are different document naming standards in use within the NHS in the UK, for example, the clinical document indexing standard used in Scotland2,3 and the standard implemented in radiology. There are also international standards4,5 for document metadata, including document names.\\n\\nThe Scottish Clinical Document Indexing Standard (EH4001) (CDIS)2,3 was created for the purpose of facilitating finding documents in a document management system and providing a standard set of metadata associated with a document to facilitate transfer of documents across systems and care boundaries. That system was produced in 2007 from a collaboration of Scottish health boards and has been adopted throughout Scotland.There are two documents which comprise the CDIS: The Clinical Document Index Guidance3, which details the metadata requirements, and the Clinical Document Indexing Standard (EH4001)2 which contains document type definitions and associated codes.\\n\\nIn recent years the Scottish CDIS has been mapped to SNOMED CT codes in addition to the Scottish Document Standard Type. It is important to note that the document type is only a part of the metadata required to adequately describe a document. Other important elements such as patient identifiers, date, author, author role, specialty, subspecialty, location, service, sensitivity and so on are described in the CDIS Guidance document3 and are graded as either ‘essential’ or ‘desirable’. An important principle of the CDIS is to avoid creating document types that include a specialty name in the definition since that information is carried in another piece of metadata attached to the document. Speciality is an essential requirement, and it must always be included in the document metadata. The CDIS is designed to grow and accommodate new document types.Initially the CDIS was managed by National Services Scotland (NSS) on behalf of the Scottish health boards. It became clear that a governance model that included a large portion of clinical input is required to maintain the CDIS as dynamic and responsive. To support the CDIS the Clinical Change Leadership Group (CCLG) took on ownership of the document and performed an extensive review in 2011. A subset of the CCLG formed the Clinical Document Indexing Virtual Reference Group (VRG). The task of that group is to respond to requests for assistance with the CDIS and for new document types and to provide a solution with a reasonably short turnaround time. The VRG operates through digital communication and consensus. The VRG enables the CDIS to evolve as a living standard responsive to the needs of health care and patients.\\n\\nThe goal of this project was to ensure that documents that form part of a digital record are appropriately named to ensure the safe and effective retrieval of documents within health and social care settings and transfer of these documents across care settings. The aim of the project was to develop a single national standard and guidance for the naming of digital health and social care documents, which recognises the existing Scottish and international standards already in use.The name of a document is often not presented to the user when an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) is used. Instead, the metadata held in the database are presented. A naming convention is most relevant where a system not initially meant to hold documents is used, and documents are uploaded to it by various users across the organisations.\\n\\nThe Professional Record Standards Body PRSB worked with the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) Health Informatics Unit (HIU) and other professional bodies to deliver this work, including the Institute of Health Records and Information Management (IHRIM), The Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Nursing.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this project, a document is defined as ‘a single set of coherent identifiable, self-contained information that is a statement of health and care information and can only be updated by total replacement’.\\n\\nIt is important that the following distinctions are recognised:\\n\\nDocument title: refers to the local name for the document as displayed on the document and not searchable, e.g. St Elsewhere Hospital Discharge Notification.\\n\\nDocument name: refers to a specific item of metadata linked to a document, that is human readable and is searchable.In this report, where the term ‘patient’ is referred to, it should be assumed that this could refer to patient, client, citizen, family or carer, depending on the context within health or social care.\\n\\nThe following use cases were identified during the project initiation and this report aims to provide recommendations that are relevant to each of these.\\n\\nIn each of these use cases, it is likely that the user will apply filters based on other metadata, such as date, author, patient name, but the definition of such metadata is outside the scope of this recommendation, which focuses solely on the human readable form in which the resulting document titles are shown to the user.\\n\\nThis section describes the approach taken to consult with health and care professionals and patients and carers on the document naming standard.\\n\\nA steering group was established with key stakeholders and interested parties from the field, as determined during stakeholder mapping. The project steering group reviewed existing working and draft document naming models in use in the NHS and internationally. These included:\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.kentandmedway.icb.nhs.uk/download_file/655/799\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS records management file naming and version control guidance\",\n    \"content\": \"1.1 Good record keeping is the back bone to any organisation. This guide is designed to give teams clear instructions on:\\n\\nCreating records\\n\\nStoring records\\n\\nNaming conventions\\n\\nReminder about records that could be available to people under the Freedom of\\n\\nInformation Act (FOI)\\n\\nReview the records held and ensuring data quality\\n\\nKeeping information safe\\n\\n1.2 This should be read in conjunction with the Records Management Policy and the Information security policy which is available via the Kent and Medway CCG Collaborations Platform.\\n\\n2.1 Every member of staff is responsible for the management of the files they create (including those they access and modify). When creating new files such as spread sheets, word processed files, discrete databases or presentations it is important to consider if there is a business need for the file.\\n\\n2.2 All electronic and paper records must conform to the CCG specifications for referencing, version control, naming, filing and filing structures, and be for a legitimate clinical or business process.2.3 All files which relate in any way to official business fall within the definition of public records under the Public Records Act 1958 and 1967 and may be disclosable under FOI. Information might also be disclosable via the Data Protection Act 2018 should someone submit a subject access request.\\n\\n2.4 When using Word, file markings can be inserted as watermarks (e.g. Draft, Confidential, Version 01 etc.) or via the file header and/or footer function.\\n\\n2.5 Protective marking denotes how a document should be treated, this affects how a document is saved, stored, transferred and whether it may be disclosed. File markings reflect the level of confidentiality the file should have.\\n\\n2.6 It is important that all CCG documentation carries the appropriate markings in order to protect privacy and confidentiality. Understanding the status of a file helps readers make appropriate decisions about distribution and storage.2.7 File markings can be set by the author of a file to ensure that other members of staff are informed of the status of the file. However, such markings will not prevent disclosure of the record under FOI, unless an exemption applies. As a general rule the following classifications for confidential files may be used:\\n\\n\\n\\nGive a unique name to each document.\\n\\n• Give a meaningful name which closely reflects the record contents. Express elements of the name in a structured and predictable order.\\n\\n? Keep file and folder names as short as possible. Locate the most specific information at the beginning of the name and most general at the end. Files/documents should be named using the following convention:Document title–Date-Version number, the date should be in the format yyyymmdd (e.g. 2018 01 01) Version indicators help to keep track of the development of a file. The format recommended is to use the ordinal number (1, 2, 3, etc.) for major version changes and decimal numbers (e.g. 0.1, 0.2) for minor changes. All drafts should have version numbers less than 1.0 (e.g. 0.4). Document types and suggested abbreviations:\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep file names short, but meaningful. Long file names mean long file paths which increase the likelihood of error, are more difficult to remember and recognise, and are more difficult to transmit in emails. However, avoid using initials, abbreviations and codes that are not commonly used.• Avoid unnecessary repetition. As above. Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces or underscores. Some software packages have difficulty recognising file names with spaces. Instead of spaces and underscores, use Capitals to separate words. If using a number in a file name – use two digits. Unless it is a year or a number with more than two digits. If using a date in a file name – use YYYYMMDD. This will ensure that in a list of files in a folder, the most recent is always at the bottom. Using personal names. This is usually used in filing correspondence. Use surname first, and then initial and the date as above. This will ensure that the correspondence will list in chronological order. Avoid using “draft” or “letter” at the start of names. There may be several documents in draft in a folder and it will be easier to locate the right document if it is filed by its title. Once a document has been ratified, all draft versions must be moved to a draft folder to avoid confusion as these would remain subject to the Freedom of Information Act and/or the Data Protection Act. When using Word and/or Excel, filenames and paths must always be displayed in the footer of the file.Naming principles are also applied to folders: ways in which this can be done include:\\n\\n• Using standard terms for themes and activities\\n\\n• Using consistent logical labels to describe business activities and functions\\n\\n• Using a clear explanation of what a folder contains People’s names for directory or folder names must not be used (job titles or roles are acceptable). In order to comply with Freedom of Information, the CCG requires a quick and easy way to find all files saved on servers, and staff are required to complete the file properties box on all documents produced. This may be achieved through the use of the properties box within each application of Microsoft Office – Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, etc.\\n\\nConsistency in where files are saved contributes to making it easier to find files. Files should be saved as follows:\\n\\nFiles which are approved by the Governing Body and which are ready to be shared across the whole CCG are also saved on the Collaborations Platform. (Documents to be placed on the Collaboration Platform must be referred to the Communications Team). Shared network drives are for files to be shared with colleagues. Personal drives should not be used for the long-term storage of corporate level files.Staff should not use emails as electronic filing cabinets, instead information should be regularly saved to shared drives.\\n\\nClinicalCommissioningGroup\\n\\n• In normal situations we would advise against saving files to personal drives as it restricts the CCG’s ability to meet its legal obligations. However, with agile working access to team drives might not always been accessible. Therefore all staff must ensure that information is stored once access is regained or forwarded to a member of the team who can save the file for you in the right place\\n\\n• The CCG requires staff to save their files to the shared network drive. If it is necessary to restrict access, raise a call with the IT Service Desk to create a new shared drive area with access restricted to designated named individuals. Ensure that the Service Desk is informed of leavers to be removed for access privileges, and new staff to be added. Files saved on personal drives should be restricted to files which do not need to be accessed by others and which will be exempt under the FOI and DPA. Information on local hard drives is not backed up, therefore loss or damage to the PC or laptop will result in permanent loss of the information.As well as using traditional folders, the increase of remote working has highlighted the use of Microsoft Teams as a tool that enables users to send instant messages, make internal calls, and share, edit and collaborate on files in a central location.\\n\\n• Any message you send via a chat is retained on Teams and will be considered a record, and therefore subject to Freedom of Information requests. You should not use inappropriate language or share unauthorised content. The same behavioural standards should be adhered to as if you were sending an email or speaking to someone directly. Discussions about other members of staff are retained, and these are also subject to the Data Protection Act 2018 and an individual’s right of access to information held about them (Subject Access Request).\\n\\n• It is important to remember that team chats could be viewable by a number of users. You should always ensure what you are discussing is appropriate for the people who have access. You can check who is included in the chat by clicking the icon in the top right-hand corner . Private conversations should be undertaken in a separate Teams chat or by email.Meetings are recordable and if a meeting is to be recorded, everyone should be advised in advance. The recording must be stored in a secure location and deleted when appropriate, for more information please contact the information governance team. It is important to remember that guests of a recurring meeting (even if they only join once), will have full access to the chat for that meeting. You should consider setting up non-reoccurring meetings invites if guests are invited.\\n\\nClinicalCommissioningGroup\\n\\nIt is likely that you will all be making and receiving calls and video meetings when working from home or at another alternate location.

The NHS England PID template PDF (`england.nhs.uk`) showed PID structure but not how to identify all related documents.\n\nThe core challenge remains: identifying all NHS funding scheme project documents. These documents vary significantly by project, funding stream, and trust, with no universal naming convention or fixed location. The script would need a way to determine which documents belong to a specific funding scheme.\n\nI'll search for how NHS trusts typically organize funding scheme project documents, what types of documents are commonly included beyond PIDs, and how to handle file selection and compression in Python with logging and error handling.\n\nAction 6:</think>\n\n", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"name": "parallel_web_search", "arguments": "{\"queries\": [\"NHS trust project document management system\", \"common NHS project funding documents list\", \"python script to zip selected files with logging and error handling\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\n  {\n    \"search_query\": \"NHS trust project document management system\",\n    \"search_results\": {\n      \"organic\": [\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Frontline Governance | Engagement | Compliance Improvement\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.mystaffapp.io/nhs-document-management-systems/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Our NHS Document Management Systems includes the following specification: Easy Document Creation; Tagging and categorisation for easy and super-fast document ...\",\n          \"position\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Special Report: Document Management | Digital Health\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2022/05/special-report-document-management-4/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"For many NHS trusts, electronic document management systems are a way to free up space and help improve patient pathways, but are there more benefits...\",\n          \"attributes\": {\n            \"Missing\": \"project | Show results with:project\"\n          },\n          \"position\": 2\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"NHS Trust Gains Easier Document Management - Storetec\",\n          \"link\": \"https://storetec.net/case-study/nhs-trust-document-management/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Storetec digitised and indexed corporate records for an NHS Trust, enhancing accessibility, compliance, and document management via MDI Cloud.\",\n          \"position\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"NHS Document Management: Secure and Compliant - CAS Ltd\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.cas.ltd/blog/casltd/accredited-nhs-document-management-services\",\n          \"snippet\": \"NHS Trusts are increasingly working with document management companies to provide expert digitisation, storage and online access to medical records.\",\n          \"position\": 4\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"MediViewer | The EDMS built for the NHS, by people from the NHS\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.mizaic.com/mediviewer/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"A secure, intuitive, scalable and searchable digital library for a paperless, connected NHS.

Please wait a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create a Python script that uses the `zipfile` module to create a ZIP archive containing NHS funding scheme project documents. The script will include error handling and logging as requested.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Script Structure:** Define a function to handle the ZIP creation process.\n2.  **Input:** The function will take the target ZIP file name and a list of document paths as input.\n3.  **ZIP Creation:** Use the `zipfile.ZipFile` class in write mode (`'w'`) to create the archive.\n4.  **Adding Files:** Iterate through the list of document paths and add each file to the ZIP archive using the `write()` method.\n5.  **Error Handling:** Implement `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during file operations (e.g., file not found, permission errors) and ZIP creation.\n6.  **Logging:** Configure Python's `logging` module to record the script's progress, including successful operations and errors.\n7.  **NHS Document Naming:** While the script itself won't enforce specific NHS naming conventions, I will mention the importance of adhering to these standards for the input documents based on the provided references.\n8.  **NHS Funding Schemes:** Briefly touch upon the context of NHS funding schemes and the types of documents involved, drawing from the provided information.\n\nBased on the provided information, NHS funding schemes involve various documents, such as:\n\n*   Project Initiation Documents (PIDs)\n*   Business Cases (Strategic Outline Case, Outline Business Case, Full Business Case)\n*   Costing Templates\n*   Funding Bid Proposals\n*   Asset Management Plans\n*   Records Management Policies and Schedules\n*   Templates for supporting documents (e.g., consent forms, contracts)\n\nAdhering to NHS document naming standards is crucial for effective records management. These standards generally recommend:\n\n*   Keeping file names short but meaningful.\n*   Using a structured and predictable order for naming elements (e.g., `DocumentTitle-Date-VersionNumber`).\n*   Using capitals to delimit words instead of spaces or underscores.\n*   Including dates in `YYYYMMDD` format.\n*   Avoiding personal names in folder names, using job titles or roles instead.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the Python script.\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nimport os\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ndef create_nhs_project_zip(zip_filename, document_paths):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a ZIP archive containing specified NHS funding scheme project documents.\n\n    Args:\n        zip_filename (str): The name of the output ZIP file.\n        document_paths (list): A list of file paths to include in the ZIP.\n    \"\"\"\n    logging.info(f\"Attempting to create ZIP archive: {zip_filename}\")\n\n    try:\n        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_filename, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:\n            for doc_path in document_paths:\n                if os.path.exists(doc_path):\n                    try:\n                        # Add the file to the zip archive\n                        zipf.write(doc_path, os.path.basename(doc_path))\n                        logging.info(f\"Added '{doc_path}' to '{zip_filename}'\")\n                    except Exception as e:\n                        logging.error(f\"Error adding file '{doc_path}' to ZIP: {e}\")\n                else:\n                    logging.warning(f\"Document not found, skipping: '{doc_path}'\")\n        logging.info(f\"Successfully created ZIP archive: {zip_filename}\")\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        logging.error(f\"Error: Could not create ZIP file. Directory may not exist.\")\n    except PermissionError:\n        logging.error(f\"Error: Permission denied to create ZIP file: {zip_filename}\")\n    except zipfile.BadZipFile:\n         logging.error(f\"Error: The created file is not a valid ZIP file.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"An unexpected error occurred during ZIP creation: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example Usage:\n    # Replace these with the actual paths to your NHS project documents\n    nhs_documents = [\n        \"path/to/your/ProjectInitiationDocument-20250526-v1.0.docx\",\n        \"path/to/your/OutlineBusinessCase-20250520-v0.8.pdf\",\n        \"path/to/your/CostingTemplate-SchemeA-20250525.xlsx\",\n        \"path/to/your/FundingBidProposal-Phase2-20250524.pdf\",\n        \"path/to/your/AssetManagementPlanExtract-Q1-2025.pdf\",\n        \"path/to/your/RecordsRetentionSchedule-PolicyExtract.pdf\",\n        \"path/to/your/ConsentFormTemplate-v1.2.docx\",\n        \"path/to/non_existent_document.txt\" # Example of a file that won't be found\n    ]\n\n    # Define the output ZIP file name\n    output_zip_name = f\"NHS_FundingScheme_Documents_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.zip\"\n\n    # Create the ZIP file\n    create_nhs_project_zip(output_zip_name, nhs_documents)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import necessary modules:** `zipfile` for working with ZIP archives, `os` for path manipulation, `logging` for logging, and `datetime` for generating a timestamp for the output filename.\n2.  **Configure Logging:** `logging.basicConfig` sets up basic logging to output messages to the console with a timestamp, log level, and message.\n3.  **`create_nhs_project_zip` function:**\n    *   Takes `zip_filename` and `document_paths` as arguments.\n    *   Uses a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during the entire process.\n    *   Opens the specified `zip_filename` in write mode (`'w'`) using `zipfile.ZipFile`. The `with` statement ensures the ZIP file is properly closed even if errors occur. `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED` is used for compression.\n    *   Iterates through the `document_paths` list.\n    *   For each `doc_path`, it checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`.\n    *   If the file exists, it attempts to add it to the ZIP archive using `zipf.write(doc_path, os.path.basename(doc_path))`. `os.path.basename(doc_path)` is used to store the file in the ZIP with just its filename, not the full path.\n    *   Includes a nested `try...except` block to catch errors specifically during the file writing process to the ZIP.\n    *   If a document is not found, a warning is logged.\n    *   Specific `except` blocks are included for `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and `zipfile.BadZipFile` for more targeted error reporting. A general `Exception` catch is included for any other unforeseen errors.\n    *   Logs informative messages about the process, including successful file additions and the final ZIP creation status.\n4.  **Example Usage (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**\n    *   Defines a list `nhs_documents` with placeholder paths to the project documents. **Remember to replace these with the actual paths on your system.**\n    *   Generates an output ZIP filename with a timestamp using `datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')`.\n    *   Calls the `create_nhs_project_zip` function to create the ZIP archive.\n\nThis script provides a robust way to bundle NHS funding scheme project documents into a single ZIP file, incorporating essential error handling and logging for better reliability and traceability. Remember to ensure the input document paths are correct and that the script has the necessary permissions to create the ZIP file in the specified location.", "tool_calls": null}]
