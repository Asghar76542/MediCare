Your responses are completely anonymous.\\n\\nStart the survey.\\n\\nThe NHS Long Term Plan committed to accelerate the uptake of selected innovative medical devices, diagnostics, and digital products, by developing the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) policy that launched on 1 April 2021. The MTFM aims to ensure patients and the NHS benefit from clinically effective and cost saving medical technologies faster and more equitably.Technologies covered by the MTFM are typically funded by commissioners from their existing allocations. This is deliverable as the technologies supported are National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended and meet the criteria to save costs and resources and make a return on investment within three years.\\n\\nNHS England and NICE jointly consulted on building an integrated, rules-based medical technologies (medtech) pathway in July 2024. Together with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NICE, we will update the policies and processes and develop an improved pathway for MedTech. For 2025/26 the MedTech Funding Mandate policy will not be supporting any additional technologies while the Rules Based Pathway for MedTech is being developed.\\n\\nRead the latest guidance here: NHS England » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate policy – guidance for NHS commissioners and providers of NHS-funded care\\n\\n2021/22 marked the first year of the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy, where four technologies were supported. Patients are, on average, now accessing these technologies in over three quarters of eligible providers.During 2021/22, the monthly number of patients accessing Heartflow increased by 35% and over the year, the innovation created over £2.2 million worth of savings for the NHS, bringing the total savings it has generated while under MTFM support to £5 million.\\n\\nGammacore and placental growth factor-based testing both saw their usage rise in 2021/22, with a further 19 trusts adopting Gammacore and eight more offering patients PLGF, despite the removal of national, ring-fenced funding. Gammacore is now offered to patients by 95% of eligible providers.\\n\\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the number of patients accessing SecurAcath rose by 518%, from 1500 to 9270 per month. In 2021/22, the innovation achieved estimated savings of £2.5million.\\n\\nThe MTFM has continued to ensure patients get quicker access to innovative technologies in 2022/23, with 141,895 patients benefitting from use of MTFM supported technologies.**Retired teacher Sue Field, who has been using Apos for a number of years describes how she has benefitted from access to Apos**:\\n\\n“I decided to try Apos treatment because at the age of 55, really wasn’t keen to have knee surgery at that time. Very quickly, even at the first appointment, I found that I was walking without as much pain and without limping and found that my symptoms eased dramatically. I can now walk for many miles without pain in my knees. I’m able to sleep at night and the benefits to my mental health and well-being have been immense.”\\n\\nTo be supported by the MTFM, technologies must meet the policy’s three criteria and align with broader NHS England programmes (for example, Net Zero). These criteria require that technologies:\\n\\nNHS England together with the Heath Innovation Network and NHS Supply Chain continuously assess published NICE guidance to understand which technologies meet this criteria.\\n\\nThe latest technology selected for support in 2024/25 is AposHealth.\\n\\nNHS providers and commissioners are encouraged to review NICE MTG76 and contact NHS Supply Chain to understand the benefits of adopting AposHealth, as well as other MTFM supported technologies.The MTFM will continue supporting the four technologies selected in 2021/22 and the seven selected for support in 2022/23.\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2022/23 were:\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2021/22 were:\\n\\nProposals in a joint NHS England and NICE consultation published in May 2024 set out how establishing a new look MedTech pathway will make it easier still for the most promising clinically and cost-effective technologies to be procured and adopted within the NHS.\\n\\nThe MTFM policy remains in place for 2024/25 and will be reviewed alongside the MedTech pathway consultation. NHS England will continue to assess guidance published by NICE whilst the new pathway is developed.\\n\\nOur FutureNHS collaboration platform contains more information and helpful resources on the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy.\\n\\nPlease email [england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net](mailto:england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net) for any queries and to request access to our FutureNHS platform.Providers wishing to implement MTFM supported technologies should contact their local HIN.\\n\\nInformation on how to procure MTFM supported technologies can be found on NHS Supply Chain’s MedTech Funding Mandate page.\\n\\nVideos available on the HIN YouTube channel, provide an overview of the policy and the financial flow between NHS England, healthcare providers and commissioners.\\n\\nThe Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool was created for health technology innovators and developers in England to help them navigate the different stages involved in getting a new technology adopted into the NHS.\\n\\nThe tool explains the innovation journey through a five-stage process, highlighting the key steps and activities involved at each stage, so that innovators can understand the end-to-end pathway from creation through to product commissioning and monitoring.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England have invested £30 million to support the adoption and acceleration of technologies which can improve patient care in 2024-25. The Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund (HTAAF) was taken up by 41 Integrated Care Systems across the country. The funds will be used to propel innovative medical technology into patients’ care pathways across various areas including: increasing remote and self-monitoring, at home management, speeding up cancer diagnostics and increasing elective capacity as well as clinical productivity. DHSC and NHS England will continue to work with frontline services over the coming year to understand the impact which these funds have had on patients.# Cookies on the NHS England website# Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support## Impact to date## How the policy works## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2024/25## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2021/22 and 2022/23## Medical technology (MedTech) pathway consultation## Additional information## Introducing the Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool## Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund\\n\\nNHS Accelerated Access Collaborative » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support\\n----------------\\nEnd of this webpage.

Visit our Apply  page for the most up-to-date information.\\n\\nWhen the NIA call opens, applicants are asked to submit an online application form detailing information about themselves and their skills, experience and competencies to spread an innovation as well as their innovation, the problem it addresses, the evidence as to its effectiveness and their strategy for scaling in the NHS.\\n\\nThe NIA exists to support the spread of innovations in the NHS in England. However, the NIA cannot offer a guaranteed route to widespread adoption across the NHS, and being on the NIA does not offer preferred supplier status.When submitted, application forms are reviewed by a minimum of five assessors drawn from a range of perspectives including clinical, patient, commercial and implementation. Applications are assessed on the basis of the applicant, the innovation, and confirmation that there is no straightforward or obvious local mechanism for scaling; in other words, there needs to be a clear reason as to why the applicant needs the support of the NIA.\\n\\nOnce shortlisted, applicants are invited to a panel interview. At the same time, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) informally reviews all shortlisted applications. After the interviews, a final decision panel chaired by Sir Stephen Powis, National Medical Director at NHS England, and Chair of the NIA Programme Board, reviews the recommendations from the assessment process (application, NICE review and interview) to agree which applicants will be offered a conditional place on the NIA.At this stage, two references are requested for each Fellow – one of whom needs to be a senior representative from the Fellow’s employing organisation; the other should be from a healthcare provider/ commissioner site where your innovation is currently in use (this does not need to be an NHS site). We also undertake a period of due diligence, and request – where relevant – two years of annual accounts, a list of company directors and published annual reports. All Fellows will be asked to sign an agreement with UCLPartners (who host the NIA) before being formally announced as an NIA Fellow. An example contract will be available on the application page of the NIA website when the Call is launched. Applicants should check that they and their employing organisation would be happy to sign this contract before applying.\\n\\nThe Health Innovation Networks (HINs) are uniquely placed to identify and support the spread health innovation at pace and scale, driving the adoption and spread of innovative ideas and technologies across large populations. There are 15 across the country and these should be your first port of call for support with your innovation.\\n\\nVisit the Health Innovation Network Innovation Exchange for more information and contact details.The NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) involves an annual competition in which individuals from a range of different backgrounds apply for support in advancing an innovation they have developed. Successful applicants are termed NIA Fellows.\\n\\nAn NIA Fellow is an exceptional individual who is being supported to scale their promising innovations through the NIA. Each of these Fellows – along with their innovations – have been through a rigorous, competitive selection process before being invited to join the NIA.\\n\\nThere are currently 35 Fellows and 64 Alumni on the NIA. Fellows have been recruited annually since 2015 – 17 in the 1st cohort, 8 in 2nd, 11 in 3rd, 13 in 4th, 11 in 5th, 12 in 6th, 10 in 7th and 17 in the 8th.Fellows come from a wide range of backgrounds, including clinical, industry and academia, and share a passion for learning and scaling innovation for patient benefit. They are committed to disseminating their learnings widely via the NIA, and all offer expertise and experience in the adoption, implementation and spread of innovation in the NHS.\\n\\nTo successfully spread innovation in the NHS, our experience has found that you need: an inspiring leader who can engage effectively and lead the scaling of a health innovation, and a great innovation, at the right level of maturity, supported by evidence and the right business model.\\n\\nThe NIA’s dual focus on personal development for individuals (‘Fellows’) and bespoke support to spread an innovation recognises that both are critical to scaling in the NHS.\\n\\nThe NIA exists to support the spread of innovations in the NHS in England. However, the NIA cannot offer a guaranteed route to widespread adoption across the NHS, and being on the NIA does not offer preferred supplier status.The ethos of the NIA is to provide a range of support in response to the needs of each Fellow and the barriers to uptake their innovation faces within the NHS. This includes a bespoke learning programme, mentorship and networking opportunities to equip Fellows with critical knowledge, relationships and skills to scale innovation in the NHS.\\n\\nEach NIA Fellow is provided with:\\n\\n– Access to a pool of mentors\\n\\n– Networking opportunities with  the Health Innovation Networks (HINs)\\n\\n– Quarterly learning events\\n\\n– Peer-to-peer support\\n\\n– Ad hoc specialist information sessions, as required (e.g. procurement, NHS commissioning, health economics, business case development, media training, etc.)\\n\\n– Navigation to existing innovation initiatives locally within HINs (e.g. SETsquared) and nationally (e.g. Global Digital Exemplars)\\n\\nAt the end of the their first year on the fellowship, each Fellow should have the following in place, with the help of the NIA:\\n\\n– A robust diffusion plan:  A critically appraised, robust diffusion plan for the NHS, which they have made progress on implementing (e.g., new contracts signed, resources secured).– Expanded networks:  Built a network of decision makers, ‘critical friends’ and other key stakeholders.\\n\\n– Navigation of innovation opportunities:  The ability to navigate innovation initiatives, support infrastructure and national levers.\\n\\n– Expanded knowledge:  Addressed critical knowledge gaps as agreed with their mentors/lead HIN/NIA core team at the programme outset.\\n\\nFellows can access support from the NIA for up to 3 years, after which they will be offered the opportunity to become an NIA Alumni.\\n\\nAn NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) Mentor is a high-profile expert with a broad skill base. Their support is predominantly in the form of advice, guidance and networking. Our pool of Mentors is regularly expanded to support the experiences and identified needs of the Fellows.\\n\\nMeet our current Mentors.\\n\\nIf you are interested in becoming an NIA Mentor, email us at nia@uclpartners.com.\\n\\nThe bar for NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) Fellows and innovations is high.All Fellows are required to demonstrate full participation in the NIA, with a consequence of exiting the programme if requirements are not met. Expectations of Fellows are detailed in the Call for Applications and the contract that Fellows, along with their organisations, are required to sign to formally join the NIA. As part of this commitment, Fellows agree to spend two days per week focused on NIA work aspects, attend the launch and quarterly events, and submit progress reports. At the start of the NIA, they will develop and agree a scaling plan with the NIA team. As part of this, Fellows agree a minimum set of activities they will deliver during the first year on the accelerator.\\n\\nFellows may be asked to leave the NIA in the event that they:\\n\\n– Break any condition in the NIA contract.\\n\\n– Do not adhere to the NIA code of conduct.\\n\\n– Are unable to attend the launch and/or quarterly events.\\n\\n– Do not deliver on agreed activities during the course of the programme.\\n\\n– Behave in a manner unacceptable to the NIA and its ethos.If a Fellow is no longer able to maintain their commitment to the NIA, for example if they are no longer working for the company supporting their innovation, they are able to put forward a replacement candidate, who will then go through a formal application process. Replacement Fellows are carefully assessed and must attend an interview with NIA stakeholders before a recommendation is ratified by the NIA programme board.\\n\\nIf for any reason a Fellow is no longer able to participate in the NIA and does not wish to be replaced, they are offered the opportunity to become an Alumni early.\\n\\nInnovations on the NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) are adopted by support of the fellow and innovation through a bespoke learning programme, mentorship and networking opportunities to equip Fellows with critical knowledge, relationships and skills to scale innovation in the NHS.\\n\\nThe NIA does not offer a guaranteed route to widespread adoption across the NHS.

Following engagement with internal and external stakeholders, the MedTech Funding Mandate policy (‘the policy’) will take effect from 1 April 2021.\\n\\nThis policy is for NHS providers and their commissioners in England and explains:\\n\\ni) the scope of the MedTech Funding Mandate\\n\\nii) which technologies are included in 2021/22 and the clinical standards required for their adoption\\n\\niii) the implementation support available via NICE tools and resources, via the Academic Health Science Network and the continuing work of the AAC team to support this policy development\\n\\niv) the steps NHS providers, NHS commissioners and suppliers of technologies need to take and how they will be supported by the policy and the academic health science networks\\n\\nv) plans for reporting activity and compliance monitoring\\n\\nvi) plans for 2022 onwards.\\n\\ni) are effective: demonstrated through a positive NICE MTG or DG;5ii) deliver material savings to the NHS: the benefits of the innovation are over £1 million over five years for the population of England;\\n\\niii) are cost-saving in-year: NICE modelling demonstrates a net saving in the first 12 months of implementing the technology;\\n\\niv) are affordable to the NHS: the budget impact should not exceed £20 million, in any of the first three years.6\\n\\nTo ensure that the adoption of this policy does not create undue burden on providers and commissioners, it is being launched in 2021/22 with a small number of products that meet the criteria above, and a fifth criterion that the products were previously supported through the ITT/ITP programmes.7\\n\\nThis fifth criterion will be in place for the first year of the MedTech Funding Mandate policy only.\\n\\nThe criterion for cost savings to be delivered within 12 months had the lowest support in the public consultation but has been retained for 2021/22 to ensure a focus on rapid return on investment while the NHS responds to the pandemic.placental growth factor based testing (PlGF) – a diagnostic test to help rule out pre-eclampsia (Triage PlGF test and the Elecsys immunoassay sFlt-1/PlGF ratio)\\n\\n• SecurAcath – for securing percutaneous catheters\\n\\n• HeartFlow FFRCT – for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography gammaCore – a handheld device which alleviates the symptoms of severe cluster headaches by stimulating the vagus nerve.\\n\\nThe MedTech Funding Mandate policy will be published annually in December following a review and feedback improvement cycle which will become effective on 1 April the following year.\\n\\nNICE MTGs and DGs will be reviewed through the year prior to the updated policy becoming effective, and a list of technologies that meet the MedTech Funding Mandate criteria will be published on the AAC webpage (in the signalling document) before end of July alongside with accompanying support to providers to help adopt these technologies as soon as possible.The technologies already covered by the policy will be reviewed to determine if any should be removed, including those for which NICE guidance has been significantly updated; alternative treatment or diagnostic options exist, or significant safety concerns have been raised. If any technologies will be withdrawn this will be signalled ahead of further policy publication.\\n\\nBy publishing the technologies which meet the criteria for the MedTech Funding Mandate for the following year in the signalling document each July we will:\\n\\ni) support more patients benefitting by enabling NHS organisations who want to use these technologies sooner to have earlier conversations about how to implement them;\\n\\nii) provide implementation support for NHS organisations that wish to adopt these technologies in year, ahead of the contractual requirement; and\\n\\niii) allow more time for discussion with industry on what implementation approaches are likely to be needed for these technologies\\n\\nChanges will also be referenced in the annual NHS Operational Planning and Contracting Guidance11.\\n\\nThe technologies covered by the MedTech Funding Mandate will be updated annually in related NHS England and NHS Improvement publications, including the National Tariff Payment System (NTPS) and NHS Standard Contract. These are typically published on the NHS England and NHS Improvement website between December and March and are subject to their own consultation processes.The MedTech Funding Mandate will also be updated in line with any relevant and significant legislative changes.\\n\\nThe publication cycle for the MedTech Funding Mandate policy and the associated signalling documents is shown in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1: Policy document publication schedule for 2021/22 to 2023/24\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the criteria for 2021/22 ensures that the technologies selected are cost-saving within 12 months (see paragraph 11), as estimated by NICE resource impact template.\\n\\nThe NICE resource impact templates for the four technologies that meet the criteria for 2021/22 estimate that:\\n\\ni) without implementation or continuation of use of these technologies, the cost of care would be around £323 million over five years;\\n\\nii) by implementing them, the cost of care reduces to £298 million over five years. Implementation would therefore achieve a net saving to the taxpayer of around £25 million over five years.\\n\\nThe savings analysis from NICE can be found in Annex 2.\\n\\nNICE also produces tools to help providers and commissioners understand the impact on their patient population shown in Annex 1.To date, NHS England and NHS Improvement have funded the cost of procuring products on the ITT/ITP programmes which have been funded directly by directly reimbursing the supplier.\\n\\nThe MedTech Funding Mandate does not directly fund the technologies included in the policy. NHS-funded care providers are to be reimbursed by their commissioner.\\n\\nAnnex A of the NTPS lists the technologies in the MedTech Funding Mandate policy, called the innovative products list. Items on this list are excluded from national prices and reimbursed by NHS commissioners.\\n\\nItems on the innovative products list are subject to NTPS local pricing rule 5, which stipulates that the price the commissioner pays must reflect actual\\n\\ncosts, the prices set under any applicable procurement framework or a reference price set by NHS England and NHS Improvement, whichever is the lowest.\\n\\nThe NHS Long Term Plan committed to moving away from activity-based funding and making almost all funding population-based. This would involve moving to blended payment for almost all services.Implementing the MedTech Funding Mandate requires an understanding of how the technologies would be used in both current and future care pathways.\\n\\nIt also requires an understanding of the potential risks and rewards the innovations may bring to both providers and commissioners, considered together as part of planning and implementing changes at a system level.\\n\\nAs it is hard to know in advance exactly what the impact of any changes will be, a risk share can be used to even out any imbalance in costs and savings between organisations to encourage implementation.\\n\\nRisk sharing can be broadly be defined in two ways:\\n\\ni) appropriately distributing risk between parties when the risks and rewards of an action are based in separate areas\\n\\nii) pre-agreed mechanisms to redistribute resources in response to variations from plan.\\n\\nIf only one organisation is involved in the innovative care pathway, then a risk share is unlikely to be needed.\\n\\nIf more than one organisation is involved, alignment between providers and commissioners may be challenging. A number of potential risk-sharing options could mitigate risk of cost and reward in different areas. There are six main areas to consider:\\n\\ni) Risk pool – this risk is where more than two organisations are involved. The main risk is system buy in and accountability due to the need for multiple agreements;ii) Cost and benefit redistribution – this risk is where one provider bears the cost of the technology, but the benefits are realised by another provider, e.g. where an NHS trust provides technology that reduces the need for community nurse visits;\\n\\niii) Risk share attached to inputs – this risk is where the implementation input, such as training cost, is a burden on one provider, but another provider also sees savings. The agreement shares the implementation cost;\\n\\niv) Income guarantee – this risk is where the technology reduces provider income by reducing the number of attendances needed or avoids the need for surgical interventions;\\n\\nv) Time delay – this risk arises when the benefits of the technology are not realised within the same period as the cost;\\n\\nvi) Variation from plan – this risk is where a technology is new it may cause\\n\\nan unplanned deviation from the planned level of activity.\\n\\nFrom 1 April 2021 the cost of the technologies purchased will flow through providers accounting systems and be included in provider’s local service-line reporting (SLR) information12 and in the annual National Cost Collection data in 2022.13\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The browsing results from Action 6 revealed:\n* **SBRI Healthcare (Phase 3):** Maximum contract duration of 12 months.

Promoting equality and addressing health inequalities are at the heart of NHS England’s values.\\n\\n2\\\\. Through research and innovation we can make an important contribution to reducing health inequalities by ensuring equitable and widespread access to proven innovations for all, and the adoption of innovations that proactively address and reduce inequalities in healthcare experience or outcomes.\\n\\n3\\\\. The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) policy works to address health inequalities in 3 ways:4\\\\. Local commissioners and providers have a central role in using innovation to reduce inequity in patient access, experience, and outcomes through the implementation of the MTFM policy.\\n\\n5\\\\. The Innovation, Research, Life Sciences Strategy (IRLSS) Patient and Public Involvement team empower patient groups and charities by communicating information on the new treatments supported by the MTFM policy. This helps patients understand what the best treatments are that should be available to them from their healthcare provider and supports them to have informed discussions with their clinicians.\\n\\n6\\\\. In the NHS Long Term Plan, NHS England outlined how research and innovation would drive better outcomes and experience for patients. An important element was the commitment to introduce a MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) policy to accelerate the adoption of selected NICE recommended, cost-saving medical devices, diagnostics and digital products in the NHS, meaning patients will get access to these technologies across England by removing funding barriers. The MTFM policy was launched in April 2021 with this document providing a policy update, effective from 1 April 2024.7\\\\. This update introduces a new technology to be supported by the MTFM policy. New information is also included on the type and duration of support given to technologies by both the Health Innovation Network and NHS England. New data dashboards have been developed and details of how to access them have been included.\\n\\n8\\\\. The Life Sciences Vision, published in July 2021, set out the government’s ambitions to build on scientific successes and tackle future challenges. It recognised the opportunity to accelerate the development of MedTech tools and get them to patients more quickly and refers to the MTFM policyas playing a critical role in addressing the most pressing needs of the NHS in England.\\n\\n9\\\\. The MTFM policy builds on prior NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) innovation programmes, such as the Innovation and Technology Tariff/Payment Programme (ITT/ITP), introduced to address financial and procurement barriers to the adoption of devices, diagnostics and digital products.10\\\\. The aim of the MTFM policy is to accelerate equitable patient access to medical technologies that are clinically effective, cost saving in 3 years (as determined by NICE) and affordable to the NHS (costs not exceeding £20 million), by supporting their implementation and then scaling them (adoption and spread).\\n\\n11\\\\. To achieve the aim, the objectives of the MTFM policy are to:\\n\\n12\\\\. In preparation for FY 2024/25, the MTFM Policy team have worked with NICE and other key partners to assess all available medical technology guidance and diagnostic guidance.\\n\\n13\\\\. We are adding one new technology to the MTFM from 1 April 2024. Systems should continue to prioritise the appropriate adoption of all supported technologies, which offer cost savings and improved patient outcomes and experiences.\\n\\n14\\\\. The IRLSS group, along with NICE, NHS Supply Chain and the Health Innovation Network (formerly the Academic Health Science Network) will continue to support national adoption of the supported technologies.\\n\\n15\\\\. The MTFM policy is for NHS providers and their commissioners in England, and explains:16\\\\. The MTFM policy was launched on 1 April 2021. This updated guidance replaces previous versions and is effective from 1 April 2024.\\n\\n17\\\\. NHS England’s IRLSS team assessed relevant NICE guidance to understand which technologies met the criteria for inclusion in the 2024/25 MTFM policy. We will continue to consider technologies proven to be clinically effective and cost-saving for inclusion in updates of this policy, with support from NHS providers, NHS Integrated Care Systems, NHS Supply Chain, the Department of Health and Social Care, Patient and Public Voices, industry representatives and representative bodies for clinicians.\\n\\n18\\\\. In the NHS Standard Contract, General Service Conditions section 2.2 states that “The Parties must comply, where applicable, with their respective obligations under, and with recommendations contained in, MTFM guidance”.\\n\\n19\\\\. In 2023/24, we reviewed published NICE guidance to identify devices, diagnostics or digital products that:\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n(1) Please refer to information on NICE guidance.(2) We reserve the right not to include a technology in the MTFM policy and/or to undertake further negotiations with technology suppliers if additional data collection is required to demonstrate sustained effectiveness.\\n\\n(3) Demonstrated by a NICE published resource impact assessment (RIA).\\n\\n(4) We reserve the right not to include a technology in the MTFM policy and/or to undertake further commercial negotiations with manufacturers if we believe the £20 million cost limit will be exceeded in any of the first 3 years.\\n\\n20\\\\. NHS England works closely with NICE to ensure that the MTFM criteria align with future changes to the medical technology evaluation process and subsequent guidance publication process.\\n\\n21\\\\. At the time of updating this policy document, NICE is in the process of transforming its methods and processes for the evaluation of outputs to multi-tech assessments. It is also developing its lifecycle evaluative approach to health technologies, capturing the value of innovation at the different stages of technology development. Technologies will be grouped into three broad categories.22\\\\. The outcome of the NICE transformation programme could have implications for the policy criteria and technology selection process. NHS England will continue to work with NICE to understand how the MTFM policy could be adapted to accommodate any future changes.\\n\\n23\\\\. Any changes to the MTFM policy, including criteria and processes, will be signalled on the MTFM webpage.\\n\\n24\\\\. We have developed a strategy for ensuring that industry and the health sector understand how long a technology will be supported by the policy, and what the package of support includes.\\n\\n25\\\\. We aim to support the national spread and adoption of each technology for 3 years. This support will be tailored to the technology, considering any barriers and enablers to adoption, and will be agreed by the Health Innovation Network National Programme Director, Health Innovation Network Technology Lead, the MTFM policy team and the technology supplier. The factors to be considered in planning a programme of support include the degree of clinical consensus, workforce impacts, the required patient pathway transformation and the maturity of a technology.\\n\\n26\\\\.

The MTFM aims to ensure patients and the NHS benefit from clinically effective and cost saving medical technologies faster and more equitably.Technologies covered by the MTFM are typically funded by commissioners from their existing allocations. This is deliverable as the technologies supported are National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended and meet the criteria to save costs and resources and make a return on investment within three years.\\n\\nNHS England and NICE jointly consulted on building an integrated, rules-based medical technologies (medtech) pathway in July 2024. Together with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NICE, we will update the policies and processes and develop an improved pathway for MedTech. For 2025/26 the MedTech Funding Mandate policy will not be supporting any additional technologies while the Rules Based Pathway for MedTech is being developed.\\n\\nRead the latest guidance here: NHS England » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate policy – guidance for NHS commissioners and providers of NHS-funded care\\n\\n2021/22 marked the first year of the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy, where four technologies were supported. Patients are, on average, now accessing these technologies in over three quarters of eligible providers.During 2021/22, the monthly number of patients accessing Heartflow increased by 35% and over the year, the innovation created over £2.2 million worth of savings for the NHS, bringing the total savings it has generated while under MTFM support to £5 million.\\n\\nGammacore and placental growth factor-based testing both saw their usage rise in 2021/22, with a further 19 trusts adopting Gammacore and eight more offering patients PLGF, despite the removal of national, ring-fenced funding. Gammacore is now offered to patients by 95% of eligible providers.\\n\\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the number of patients accessing SecurAcath rose by 518%, from 1500 to 9270 per month. In 2021/22, the innovation achieved estimated savings of £2.5million.\\n\\nThe MTFM has continued to ensure patients get quicker access to innovative technologies in 2022/23, with 141,895 patients benefitting from use of MTFM supported technologies.**Retired teacher Sue Field, who has been using Apos for a number of years describes how she has benefitted from access to Apos**:\\n\\n“I decided to try Apos treatment because at the age of 55, really wasn’t keen to have knee surgery at that time. Very quickly, even at the first appointment, I found that I was walking without as much pain and without limping and found that my symptoms eased dramatically. I can now walk for many miles without pain in my knees. I’m able to sleep at night and the benefits to my mental health and well-being have been immense.”\\n\\nTo be supported by the MTFM, technologies must meet the policy’s three criteria and align with broader NHS England programmes (for example, Net Zero). These criteria require that technologies:\\n\\nNHS England together with the Heath Innovation Network and NHS Supply Chain continuously assess published NICE guidance to understand which technologies meet this criteria.\\n\\nThe latest technology selected for support in 2024/25 is AposHealth.\\n\\nNHS providers and commissioners are encouraged to review NICE MTG76 and contact NHS Supply Chain to understand the benefits of adopting AposHealth, as well as other MTFM supported technologies.The MTFM will continue supporting the four technologies selected in 2021/22 and the seven selected for support in 2022/23.\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2022/23 were:\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2021/22 were:\\n\\nProposals in a joint NHS England and NICE consultation published in May 2024 set out how establishing a new look MedTech pathway will make it easier still for the most promising clinically and cost-effective technologies to be procured and adopted within the NHS.\\n\\nThe MTFM policy remains in place for 2024/25 and will be reviewed alongside the MedTech pathway consultation. NHS England will continue to assess guidance published by NICE whilst the new pathway is developed.\\n\\nOur FutureNHS collaboration platform contains more information and helpful resources on the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy.\\n\\nPlease email [england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net](mailto:england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net) for any queries and to request access to our FutureNHS platform.Providers wishing to implement MTFM supported technologies should contact their local HIN.\\n\\nInformation on how to procure MTFM supported technologies can be found on NHS Supply Chain’s MedTech Funding Mandate page.\\n\\nVideos available on the HIN YouTube channel, provide an overview of the policy and the financial flow between NHS England, healthcare providers and commissioners.\\n\\nThe Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool was created for health technology innovators and developers in England to help them navigate the different stages involved in getting a new technology adopted into the NHS.\\n\\nThe tool explains the innovation journey through a five-stage process, highlighting the key steps and activities involved at each stage, so that innovators can understand the end-to-end pathway from creation through to product commissioning and monitoring.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England have invested £30 million to support the adoption and acceleration of technologies which can improve patient care in 2024-25. The Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund (HTAAF) was taken up by 41 Integrated Care Systems across the country. The funds will be used to propel innovative medical technology into patients’ care pathways across various areas including: increasing remote and self-monitoring, at home management, speeding up cancer diagnostics and increasing elective capacity as well as clinical productivity. DHSC and NHS England will continue to work with frontline services over the coming year to understand the impact which these funds have had on patients.# Cookies on the NHS England website# Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support## Impact to date## How the policy works## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2024/25## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2021/22 and 2022/23## Medical technology (MedTech) pathway consultation## Additional information## Introducing the Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool## Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund\\n\\nNHS Accelerated Access Collaborative » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support\\n----------------\\nEnd of this webpage.

The longer-term benefits centre on people being able to function more effectively in their daily lives and participate more fully in society with less or minimal support from external health or social welfare agencies. There are also likely to be wider benefits of reduced health inequalities from improved access to healthcare. Costs and quality of care may benefit from prevention of disease occurring, and prevention of exacerbation of an existing disease or condition which reduces the need to visit a GP or receive hospital treatment.Current wider system benefits emerged from reducing purchasing barriers through the introduction of the NHS Innovation and Technology Tariff, raising the profile of innovation in the NHS, stimulating wider cultural change through conversations with NHS organisations and bringing groups such as AHSNs together to demonstrate models of collaborative working to diffuse healthcare innovations. Future benefits may include NHS service improvement, illustration of new ways of diffusing innovation in the NHS and improvements to global healthcare, since a number of innovations were scaling or planning to scale into other countries.\\n\\nChapter Four provides an economic assessment of the value of the innovations and assesses whether they are cost effective, using a mixture of return on investment, cost consequence and cost utility analysis. The exact scale of benefits will depend on the number of times innovations are used in practice. It was easier to test the potential return on investment for innovations designed to achieve safety and efficiency, as they have clear input costs and comparisons with usual care are possible.The conservative estimates made suggest that some of the innovations could generate significant savings to the health and social care system. The value of total benefits could be higher, because this calculation does not include benefits that cannot be easily quantified at this stage, or other benefits that have value, both to patients, the health and social care system and to society via increased productivity. Furthermore, there is the potential that benefits across the country are underestimated, as the full extent of scaling is not known. The value of the benefits from these innovations (based on data available and assumptions made) are thought to exceed the costs of the NIA programme in one year.\\n\\nThese results should be interpreted with caution however, due to the quality of the data available and the depth of analysis possible in some cases. Examples of the kinds of limitations in the analyses were as follows:\\n\\nuncertainty about innovation input costs;\\n\\nassumptions required about the attribution of impacts to the innovation;\\n\\nevidence from limited sources;\\n\\nrequirement to use evidence from overseas; and lack of quantifiable outcome data.Global health benefits. These derive from the NIA’s potential to accelerate innovation scaling to other countries outside the UK. A number of Fellows were expanding their markets either as a result of UK success or partly in response to difficulties for some Fellows in gaining traction for innovation uptake in the NHS. Episcissors was focussing on diffusion in five countries. Sleepio and PneuX had made progress in the USA while HealthUnlocked and myCOPD were intending to extend projects to the USA, and myCOPD was also working with countries in Asia. Brush DJ was already gaining high ratings from user communities as a health app and had been downloaded in 197 countries with the possibility of a major focus on overseas take up. Sapientia had similarly expanded into a range of countries including the USA and China..The aim of the economic impact analysis was to identify the effect on resource use in the NHS and broader public sector, the benefits for patients, and any other economic benefits resulting from the NIA funding and support. Due to the variation between the innovations, different types of economic analysis were considered. Although these different approaches mean that conclusions about the different innovations cannot be directly compared, these nevertheless give an indication of the relative impact of the innovation on cost and benefits. The types of economic analysis were:\\n\\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA):\\n\\ncompares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of different courses of action, eg patient outcomes such as reduced infection\\n\\ncost-utility analysis - a form of CEA which uses a single common outcome measure (utility value), usually the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY).\\n\\nCost-benefit analysis (CBA):\\n\\ncosts and outcomes monetised, eg return on investment (ROI), threshold analysis (the cost above which the innovation ceases to be cost-effective).\\n\\nCost-consequence analysis (CCA):\\n\\ncosts and consequences are described and compared consequences can be a range of clinical and other patient measures, eg tooth decay, clinical complications.The approach used is determined by the information and data available for the analysis. If data are available on the incremental costs and outcomes, it is possible to conduct a costeffectiveness analysis, comparing the economic value of an intervention with an alternative. Where QALYs are used as the measure of health effect, this allows comparison across disease areas and informs whether the new intervention is an efficient use of healthcare resources, eg Liver Disease Diagnostic Pathway. If costs and benefits can be identified and expressed in monetary terms, it is possible to undertake a costbenefit analysis and for commissioners to compare the amount of return on a project relative to its cost, eg Episcissors-60, Kardia Mobile. Various outcomes are valued to a\\n\\ngreater or lesser extent by different stakeholders, so even if consequences cannot be monetised they may still have significant ‘value’. Hence a cost-consequence analysis can be informative, particularly when taking a wider societal perspective, eg Brush DJ.\\n\\nWhere good quality data are not available, analyses may require assumptions to be made and the results of the analyses should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nExamples of the kinds of limitations in these analyses were as follows:\\n\\nuncertainty about innovation input costs;assumptions required about the attribution of impacts to the innovation;\\n\\nevidence from limited sources;\\n\\nrequirement to use evidence from overseas; and lack of quantifiable outcome data.\\n\\nThe key tasks for the economic analysis were to identify, measure and value the inputs and outcomes of the interventions. These were analysed to identify the incremental costs and benefits of each innovation and calculate their net benefits. The information from the impact webs and interviews with Fellows was synthesised and supplemented by data and evidence collection using a bespoke analysis template for each innovation. Further interviews with Fellows were undertaken where needed. The information was used to develop a case study for each innovation. Where ROI calculations were possible, a bespoke ROI calculator was built, so that parameters in the analysis could be varied to test the impact of any assumptions made or uncertainty in the data/costs available. The analyses were developed in spring 2017 and are based on the information and evidence available at the time. The limitations of the analysis undertaken are stated within each case study and where assumptions have been required, these are clearly stated.The detailed case studies for each innovation are available on the NIA website. ROI calculators have been developed for three of the innovations and these were available to the Fellows. A summary of the resource inputs, outcomes and findings for each innovation, are included in Table 4.1. The conclusions are based on current understanding and information/evidence returned in the analysis templates. Further detail on the assumptions made, sensitivity analysis performed and limitations of the analyses can be found in the case studies.\\n\\nTable 4.1: Summary of economic impact analysis for NIA innovations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsocietal benefits when the potential impacts on productivity are included.The preceding analysis shows that a number of innovations generate cost savings and a positive return on investment at organisational or CCG level (AliveCor Kardia Mobile, PneuX, NIC, Episcissors-60, health coaching, myCOPD). The exact scale of benefits across the country will depend on the number of times these innovations are used in practice. It has been easier to test the potential return on investment for innovations designed to achieve safety and efficiency as they have clear input costs and comparisons with usual care are possible. For Health Coaching, while implementation is widespread and diverse and it is not possible to quantify the total benefits from the roll out of this approach, the evidence indicates that the value of benefits has the potential to far exceed input costs. In the case of the Scarred Liver Pathway, a comprehensive economic analysis has shown this to be cost effective in that it achieves better health outcomes for a slightly higher cost than usual care.For some innovations there is evidence of potential to generate significant savings but it is not possible to establish the return on investment as the input costs of the innovations are not clear. This is either for reasons of commercial sensitivity, or because the costs have not yet been established (Sapientia, Patients Know Best, NeuroResponse). Conversely, for other innovations input costs are known and the expected benefits have been identified, but the benefits cannot be easily measured (Brush DJ, HealthUnlocked, Join Dementia Research, iThrive, Sleepio, OWise).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.nice.org.uk/Media/Default/What-we-do/Into-practice/Assessing-resource-impact-process-manual.docx\",\n    \"query\": \"NICE Resource Impact Assessment (RIA) methodology for NHS funding schemes\",\n    \"content\": \"Webpage crawl result is empty\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The browsing results from Action 10 provided:\n* **SBRI Healthcare (Phase 3):** Maximum contract duration of 12 months.

Please wait a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided information, I can outline the structure and key components for a financial projection model focusing on Return on Investment (ROI) for NHS UK government funding schemes, specifically SBRI Healthcare, NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA), and the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM).\n\nIt's important to note that while the provided documents offer insights into the aims, structure, funding limits, and some impact data for these schemes, they do not contain the granular financial data (e.g., specific cost savings per patient for all supported technologies, detailed program operational costs, precise adoption rate data across all innovations) required to build a fully detailed, real-time financial projection model with exact ROI calculations and forecasting for *various investment scenarios* and *sensitivity analysis for all key variables* as requested. The information allows for a conceptual framework and illustrative examples based on available data.\n\nTherefore, this response will focus on outlining the structure of such a model, identifying the necessary components based on the available information, and highlighting the data limitations.\n\n### Financial Projection Model for NHS UK Government Funding Schemes\n\nA comprehensive financial projection model for NHS funding schemes would typically involve the following components:\n\n1.  **Scheme Overview and Data Inputs:**\n    *   **Scheme Identification:** Define the specific funding scheme (SBRI Healthcare, NIA, MTFM).\n    *   **Funding Mechanism:** Detail how funding is provided (e.g., phased funding, mandated procurement).\n    *   **Investment Amount:** Input the initial investment or funding received from the scheme.\n    *   **Project/Innovation Costs:** Include all costs associated with developing, implementing, and scaling the innovation within the NHS context. This would ideally include labor, materials, capital equipment, sub-contractors, travel, indirect costs, and other project-specific costs, as outlined in the SBRI Healthcare guidance.\n    *   **Time Horizon:** Define the projection period (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years), aligning with the typical support duration or expected return period of the schemes (e.g., MTFM's 3-year cost-saving criteria).\n\n2.  **Benefit Identification and Quantification:**\n    *   **Types of Benefits:** Identify the potential benefits of the innovation within the NHS. Based on the provided information, these can include:\n        *   Improved clinical outcomes (e.g., reduced hospital visits, better disease management).\n        *   Cost savings (e.g., reduced procedures, shorter hospital stays, less reliance on other services).\n        *   Increased efficiency and productivity (e.g., freeing up workforce capacity, faster diagnosis).\n        *   Improved patient experience and quality of life.\n        *   Addressing health inequalities and improving equitable access.\n        *   Wider societal benefits (e.g., increased productivity).\n    *   **Quantifying Benefits:** Assign monetary values to the identified benefits where possible. This is a critical and often challenging step, requiring robust data. The provided information mentions NICE resource impact assessments (RIAs) and tools that estimate cost savings, which would be a key data source for this section. Examples of quantifiable benefits mentioned include:\n        *   Estimated cost savings from specific MTFM technologies (e.g., HeartFlow, SecurAcath).\n        *   Reduced GP visits or hospital treatments due to innovation use.\n    *   **Adoption/Diffusion Rate:** Project the rate at which the innovation is adopted and used across eligible NHS providers and patients. This is a crucial variable influencing the scale of benefits realized. The NIA's focus on scaling and the MTFM's mandate aim to accelerate this.\n\n3.  **ROI Calculation:**\n    *   **Formula:** The standard ROI calculation is (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs.\n    *   **Adaptation for NHS:** In the NHS context, \"benefits\" often include both direct cost savings and broader value (clinical outcomes, patient experience). The model should ideally capture both, potentially presenting a financial ROI (based on quantifiable cost savings) and a broader value assessment.\n    *   **Time Value of Money:** Incorporate discounting to reflect the time value of money, especially for longer projection periods.\n\n4.  **Forecasting Models:**\n    *   **Scenario Planning:** Develop different investment scenarios based on varying levels of funding, adoption rates, and project timelines.\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Analyze the impact of changes in key variables on the ROI. Critical variables identified from the references include:\n        *   Adoption rate of the innovation.\n        *   Magnitude of cost savings per patient/use.\n        *   Implementation costs within NHS settings.\n        *   Regulatory timelines and hurdles.\n        *   Changes in NICE guidance or MTFM criteria.\n    *   **Data Requirements for Forecasting:** Accurate forecasting requires historical data on similar innovations, market analysis, and detailed understanding of NHS implementation pathways.\n\n5.  **Investment Comparison Dashboard:**\n    *   **Scheme Comparison:** Present the projected ROI and other relevant metrics (e.g., time to positive ROI, number of patients impacted) for different funding schemes or specific innovation projects within those schemes.\n    *   **Key Metrics:** Include metrics such as:\n        *   Projected ROI (financial and/or value-based).\n        *   Total projected cost savings.\n        *   Estimated number of patients benefiting.\n        *   Time to achieve widespread adoption.\n    *   **Visualizations:** Use tables and charts to compare the performance of different investment opportunities visually.\n\n### Application to Specific Schemes based on Available Information:\n\n**SBRI Healthcare:**\n\n*   **Focus:** Provides development funding to innovators for disruptive solutions meeting unmet NHS needs.\n*   **Phases:** Offers funding across different phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3).\n    *   Phase 1: Up to £100,000 (excluding VAT), maximum 6 months. Focus on feasibility and proof of concept.\n    *   Phase 2: Up to £800,000 (excluding VAT). Focus on development and testing.\n    *   Phase 3: Up to £500,000 (excluding VAT), maximum 12 months. Supports implementation studies and real-world evidence generation.\n*   **ROI Considerations:** ROI for SBRI Healthcare investments would be calculated based on the funding received in each phase and the projected benefits realized if the innovation successfully progresses and is adopted within the NHS. The evaluation strategy for Phase 3 projects explicitly requires consideration of economic assessment, including return on investment.\n*   **Data Availability:** Information on funding limits per phase is available. Some examples of funded projects and their aims are mentioned, but detailed financial outcomes for a wide range of projects are not provided.\n\n**NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA):**\n\n*   **Focus:** Accelerates uptake of high-impact, evidence-based innovations across the NHS by supporting individuals (\"Fellows\") and their innovations.\n*   **Support:** Provides bespoke support, mentorship, networking, learning programmes, and a bursary (up to £50k per Fellow).\n*   **ROI Considerations:** ROI for NIA would consider the investment in the program (including bursaries and operational costs) against the benefits generated by the scaled innovations. The evaluation of the NIA has included economic impact analysis, using methods like cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit analysis (including ROI), and cost-consequence analysis.\n*   **Data Availability:** The evaluation report mentions that some NIA innovations have demonstrated potential for significant savings and positive ROI at the organizational or CCG level. It also notes limitations in data availability for a comprehensive ROI calculation across all innovations. Examples of innovations and their potential benefits are provided (e.g., reduced GP visits, improved patient outcomes).\n\n**MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM):**\n\n*   **Focus:** Accelerates the uptake of selected NICE-approved, cost-saving medical devices, diagnostics, and digital products by mandating their funding by commissioners.\n*   **Criteria:** Technologies must be clinically effective (NICE guidance), deliver material savings (£1M over 5 years for England), be cost-saving in-year (for 2021/22), and affordable (£20M budget impact limit in the first 3 years).\n*   **ROI Considerations:** The MTFM is inherently focused on technologies with a demonstrated ROI (cost savings within a specified timeframe). The ROI calculation would compare the cost of procuring and implementing the mandated technology against the cost savings and other benefits realized by the NHS.\n*   **Data Availability:** The policy documents provide examples of technologies supported and some estimated savings (e.g., HeartFlow, SecurAcath). NICE RIAs are a key source for cost-saving estimates. The policy also outlines how funding flows (commissioners fund from existing allocations) and the importance of considering risk-sharing where costs and benefits are realized by different entities.\n\n### Structure of the Financial Projection Model:\n\nThe model could be structured with different modules for each funding scheme, allowing for separate analysis while also enabling a comparative dashboard.\n\n**Module for Each Scheme (SBRI Healthcare, NIA, MTFM):**\n\n*   **Input Sheet:**\n    *   Innovation/Project Name\n    *   Funding Amount Received\n    *   Projected Timeline\n    *   Cost Breakdown (Labor, Materials, etc.)\n    *   Target Patient Population Size\n    *   Projected Adoption Rate (e.g., % of eligible patients/providers using the innovation over time)\n    *   Estimated Cost Savings per Patient/Use (based on NICE RIAs or other evidence)\n    *   Quantifiable Non-Financial Benefits (if data is available)\n    *   Discount Rate\n*   **Calculation Sheet:**\n    *   Calculate total project costs over the timeline.\n    *   Calculate total projected benefits (cost savings, monetized benefits) based on adoption rate and per-unit savings.\n    *   Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of costs and benefits.\n    *   Calculate ROI: (Total Discounted Benefits - Total Discounted Costs) / Total Discounted Costs.\n    *   Calculate payback period (time to achieve positive cumulative net benefit).\n*   **Output/Summary Sheet:**\n    *   Display key financial metrics (ROI, NPV, Payback Period).\n    *   Present sensitivity analysis results (e.g., ROI under different adoption rate scenarios).\n    *   Summarize non-financial benefits.\n\n**Investment Comparison Dashboard:**\n\n*   **Table/Chart:** Compare key metrics (ROI, NPV, etc.) across different innovations or funding schemes.\n*   **Filters:** Allow users to filter by scheme, health category, or other relevant criteria.\n\n### Data Limitations and Considerations:\n\nBuilding a truly detailed and accurate model would require access to specific data points that are not fully available in the provided documents, including:\n\n*   Detailed, innovation-specific cost breakdowns for development and implementation within the NHS.\n*   Actual adoption rates across a wide range of innovations supported by each scheme.\n*   Comprehensive, publicly available NICE RIAs or other robust economic evaluations for all relevant technologies.\n*   Precise data on the operational costs of running the NIA and SBRI Healthcare programs.\n*   Quantifiable data on non-financial benefits across various innovations.\n\nTherefore, while the structure can be built, the accuracy of the projections will depend heavily on the availability and quality of the input data. The model would likely need to rely on assumptions and estimates where specific data is lacking, and the sensitivity analysis would be crucial to understand the impact of these uncertainties.\n\nIn conclusion, a financial projection model for NHS UK government funding schemes can be designed with modules for SBRI Healthcare, NIA, and MTFM, focusing on ROI calculation, forecasting, and sensitivity analysis. However, the practical implementation and accuracy of such a model are contingent upon obtaining detailed financial and adoption data for the innovations supported by these schemes. The provided information offers a strong foundation for understanding the components and considerations for such a model, particularly highlighting the importance of cost savings, adoption rates, and economic evaluation as key drivers of ROI within the NHS context.", "tool_calls": null}]
