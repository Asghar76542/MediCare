It is for use with new suppliers and should also be utilised with existing suppliers who may not have previously completed a DTAC assessment at the discretion of the Trust. This procedure formalises current Trust practice.\\n\\nDTAC is designed to be used by healthcare organisations to assess suppliers at the point of procurement or as part of a due diligence process, to make sure digital technologies meet our minimum baseline standards. For developers, it sets out what is expected for entry into the NHS and social care and forms a baseline structured framework.\\n\\nOur Journey To Change sets out why we do what we do, the kind of organisation we want to become and the way we will get there by living our values, all of the time. To achieve this, the Trust has committed to three goals. This procedure supports all three goals of Our Journey To Change.Goals 1 (To co-create a great experience for patients, carers, and families) and 2 (To cocreate a great experience for our colleagues): DTAC gives staff, patients and citizens confidence that the digital health tools they use meet our clinical safety, data protection, technical security, interoperability and usability and accessibility standards. Implementing this procedure provides assurance to patients, careers, families, and staff that when systems and processes are introduced or changed, their privacy, data security and clinical safety has been considered from the outset.\\n\\nGoal 3 (To be a great partner): The DTAC brings together legislation and good practice in these areas. It is the national baseline criteria for digital health technologies entering and already used in the NHS and social care. Information and its governance is a key communication tool and is strategic in assisting the Trust when it works with key partners either to improve services or to jointly care for patients. When we tell our patients who we work with and have robust agreements about what is going to be shared we enable information to support outstanding care and service delivery with our partners.All new digital technology should be assessed using the DTAC, whether it be in pilot/trial or procured/adopted for full implementation. If multiple products are to be considered, each one would require a DTAC.\\n\\nExamples of products include: staff facing and patient facing digital health tech, health apps, medical devices and devices with an associated app, systems, web based portals and any IT enabled technology across the Trust. Following this procedure will ensure the Trust:-\\n\\n• Meets its legal obligations in carrying out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data in support of the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process.\\n\\n• Ensures that good cyber hygiene is being followed and/or remediated should any gaps in process or systems be highlighted as part of this process.\\n\\n• Helps to improve supply chain transparency and build strong foundational relationships.\\n\\n• Complies with standard DCB0160 mandated under Health and Social Care Act 2012 ensuring all Health IT has been risk assessed in order to minimise potential patient harm\\n\\nThis procedure is to be followed when introducing a new digital technology, whether it be in pilot/trial or procured/adopted for full implementation.The assessment criteria is focused on 5 core areas. Sections 1 to 4 form the assessed criteria, with a separate conformity rating provided around usability and accessibility which is assessed as part of overall procurement:\\n\\nA DTAC new supplier assessment will be sent to new suppliers for completion as part of standard procurement process.\\n\\nProducts are assessed to ensure that clinical safety measures are in place and that organisations undertake clinical risk management activities to manage this risk.\\n\\nIn order for the Trust to procure a product which impacts or influences direct patient care. Products or systems must comply with the Health and social care act 2012 by having DCB0160 Accreditation.\\n\\nExamples of products or systems that must comply with DCB0160, Electronic Patient Record systems, Digital Medical devices, IT systems supporting patient treatment such as CBT, Diagnostic tools, Telehealth. CCTV, bodycams and other recording devices\\n\\nExamples of products or systems that do not need to comply with DCB0160 Health rostering, business systems or systems which only exist for research and development systemsThe Trust has an existing Clinical Safety Case process which pre-dates DTAC and will continue to be used as it meets requirement. The Trust may on occasion sub contract out clinical safety cases or reviews of existing cases.

The in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/746) (EU IVDR) has applied in EU Member States and Northern Ireland since 26 May 2022. As these EU regulations did not take effect during the transition period, they were not EU law automatically retained by the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and therefore do not apply in Great Britain.There is further information below on how devices that have already been registered with the MHRA under the EU MDR or the EU IVDR are regulated.\\n\\nThe MHRA performs market surveillance of medical devices on the UK market and is able to take decisions over the marketing and supply of devices in the UK.\\n\\nThe MHRA is responsible for the designation and monitoring of UK conformity assessment bodies.\\n\\nFurther guidance is available on how the MHRA enforces the legislation on medical devices.\\n\\nManufacturers wishing to place a device on the Great Britain market need to register with the MHRA. More information on registrations (including fees) is available in the MHRA registrations guidance.\\n\\nWhere a manufacturer is not established in the UK, they must appoint a UK responsible person to register and act on their behalf. See guidance on UK responsible persons below for more information.\\n\\nManufacturers must comply with relevant product marking and conformity assessment requirements for medical devices. See below for guidance on the UKCA marking and UK approved bodies, and guidance on CE marking and notified bodies for more information.The government has put in place legislation to extend acceptance of CE marked devices in Great Britain beyond 30 June 2023 as outlined in the summary above. For more detail of these transitional arrangements see the implementation update on work towards a strengthened future medical devices regime.\\n\\nAll medical devices, including IVDs, custom-made devices and systems or procedure packs must be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain market. In Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), devices will be required to conform to the UK MDR 2002, with transitional arrangements for acceptance of CE marked medical devices as set out above, in order to be registered with the MHRA.\\n\\nThe MHRA will only accept registration of devices from manufacturers where the manufacturer is based in the UK. If the manufacturer is based outside the UK, they must appoint a UK responsible person. This UK responsible person will then assume certain responsibilities on behalf of the manufacturer as described below in the guidance for UK responsible persons, including registering the device with the MHRA.\\n\\nWhere any new registrations or changes to existing registrations are made, a £240 standard fee will apply per application.Failure to register your devices will mean that you are unable to lawfully place your device on the Great Britain market.\\n\\nIf you are a Northern Ireland-based manufacturer and have already registered your device with the MHRA for the purposes of the Northern Ireland market, it can then be placed on the Great Britain market and will not need to undergo any further registration in Great Britain.\\n\\nFurther information on registration requirements for Northern Ireland is available below.\\n\\nMore information on registrations (including fees) is available in the MHRA registrations guidance.\\n\\nAs noted above, to place a device on the Great Britain market (England, Wales and Scotland), manufacturers based outside the UK must appoint a UK responsible person.\\n\\nThe UK responsible person must provide written evidence that they have the manufacturer’s authority to act as their UK responsible person.\\n\\nImporters and distributors do not need to appoint a UK responsible person.Note that the accounts of any former Great Britain-based authorised representatives that have not updated their role to UK responsible person on the MHRA registration system, as well as the accounts of any represented manufacturers, have been suspended as of 1 January 2022 until the relevant UK responsible person has updated their role. For further information on registration requirements, see guidance on registering medical devices.\\n\\nThe UK responsible person acts on behalf of the non-UK manufacturer to carry out specified tasks in relation to the manufacturer’s obligations. As noted above, this includes registering the manufacturer’s devices with the MHRA before the devices can be placed on the Great Britain market.\\n\\nThe responsibilities of the UK responsible person are set out in the UK MDR 2002\\\\. In summary, in addition to the above registration requirements, the UK responsible person must:\\n\\nThere is nothing to prevent an importer or distributor from also acting as a UK responsible person.The name and address of the UK responsible person, where applicable, must be included on the product labelling or the outer packaging, or the instructions for use in cases where the UKCA marking has been affixed. UK responsible person details do not need to be included on labelling for CE marked devices, unless the device bears both the CE and UKCA markings.\\n\\nIn cases where the Great Britain importer is not the UK responsible person, the importer must inform the relevant manufacturer or UK responsible person of their intention to import a device. In such cases, the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s UK responsible person must provide the MHRA with details of device importers. See further guidance on device registrations.\\n\\nObligations around storage, transportation and checking device labels for the CE marking or UKCA marking also apply. The importer or distributor’s name and address do not need to be present on the label unless the importer or distributor are acting as the UK responsible person for the purposes of the UKCA marking.The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is a UK product marking used for certain goods, including medical devices, being placed on the Great Britain market (England, Wales and Scotland). The UKCA marking is not recognised in the EU, EEA or Northern Ireland markets, so relevant products require a CE marking for sale in these markets.\\n\\nManufacturers of medical devices can use either the UKCA marking or the CE marking on devices they place on the Great Britain market until 30 June 2023. The government has introduced measures to extend acceptance of CE marked devices in Great Britain beyond 30 June 2023 as outlined in the summary above. For more detail of these transitional arrangements see the implementation update on work towards a strengthened future medical devices regime.\\n\\nWhere third party conformity assessment is required for UKCA marking, a UK approved body is needed. However, manufacturers of non-sterile and non-measuring Class I devices and general IVDs can self-certify against the UKCA marking.\\n\\nSee the guidance Using the UKCA mark for further information.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/product-development-awards-pda-april-2025/2025284-2025285-2025286-2025287\",\n    \"query\": \"NIHR i4i Product Development Award compliance requirements and approval process\",\n    \"content\": \"Temporary error.

This guide outlines the key regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements associated with prominent NHS UK government funding schemes, providing a roadmap for innovators.\n\n### Relevant Regulatory Frameworks\n\nInnovations entering the UK healthcare market must adhere to specific regulatory requirements to ensure safety, quality, and efficacy. The primary regulatory body is the **Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)**, responsible for overseeing medicines and medical devices, including software. All medical devices must be registered with the MHRA before being sold in the UK.\n\nMedical devices are categorized into four classes based on risk, from Class I (low risk) to Class III (high risk). The classification dictates the level of evaluation required for regulatory approval.\n\nFor digital health technologies, the **Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)** is a recommended tool that consolidates legislation and best practices. While not currently mandatory, DTAC is increasingly used by healthcare organizations during procurement and due diligence to ensure digital technologies meet minimum NHS standards in areas such as clinical safety, data protection, technical security, interoperability, and usability. Compliance with standards like DCB0126 and Cyber Essentials is incorporated into DTAC.\n\nMedical devices placed on the Great Britain market must have either a **UKCA marking** or a **CE marking**, depending on the legislation under which the device has been certified. The UKCA marking signifies compliance with UK medical device regulations, while the CE marking indicates compliance with relevant EU regulations. Devices can carry both markings. Manufacturers based outside the UK must appoint a UK responsible person to register devices with the MHRA and act on their behalf.\n\n### Compliance Requirements for NHS UK Government Funding Schemes\n\nSeveral NHS UK government funding schemes support healthcare innovation. While the specific focus and stage of development supported vary, regulatory compliance is a common prerequisite.\n\n#### NHS Innovation Service\n\nThe NHS Innovation Service acts as an information gateway and single entry point for innovators, providing guidance on regulations, standards, real-world evidence requirements, and procurement processes. It connects innovators with support organizations to help navigate the necessary steps for adoption within the NHS. While the service itself doesn't provide funding, it is crucial for understanding the regulatory pathway required for successful market entry and subsequent funding opportunities.\n\n#### SBRI Healthcare\n\nThe Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) Healthcare programme, funded by the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC), provides development funding to innovations addressing unmet NHS needs. The program supports projects through different phases.\n\n| SBRI Healthcare Phase | Funding Amount (Net, excl. VAT) | Duration    | Focus                                                                 | Regulatory Consideration                                                                 |\n| :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Phase 1               | Up to £100,000                  | 6 months    | Technical feasibility testing, product development, market research, user testing, clinical validation | Projects should aim to substantially progress towards regulatory requirements for Phase 2. |\n| Phase 2               | Not specified                   | Not specified | Further development and validation                                    | Regulatory approval is a key challenge to address for successful progression.            |\n| Phase 3               | Independent from Phases 1 & 2   | Not specified | Not specified                                                         | Previous SBRI award is not a prerequisite.                                               |\n\nApplicants for SBRI Healthcare funding must complete all mandatory fields in the application form, provide a detailed budget, and describe team members, partners, and subcontractors. The application requires a plain English summary, a detailed description of the proposed idea and its alignment with NHS needs, and a project plan with milestones and risk mitigation. Demonstrating NHS readiness, including consideration of regulatory pathways, is important for securing funding.\n\n#### Other Identified Programs\n\nWhile the provided information highlights SBRI Healthcare, other funding opportunities exist within the UK innovation ecosystem. These may include programs from UKRI, research councils, Innovate UK, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), such as the Invention for Innovation (i4i) program with its Product Development Awards (PDA) and THRIVE initiatives. These programs often require a demonstration of how the innovation will navigate regulatory hurdles to reach the market and benefit the NHS. Specific regulatory compliance requirements will vary depending on the nature of the innovation and the specific funding call.\n\n### Approval Pathways and Timelines\n\nThe approval pathway and associated timelines are highly dependent on the nature and classification of the innovation.\n\n*   **Medical Devices:** The MHRA is responsible for regulating medical devices. The process involves demonstrating conformity with the UK MDR 2002 (or relevant EU directives for CE marking). This typically involves a conformity assessment, which for higher-risk devices requires a UK approved body. Registration with the MHRA is mandatory before placing a device on the market in Great Britain. The MHRA has published a revised roadmap for the future regulatory framework for medical devices, indicating intended timelines for implementation.\n*   **Digital Health Technologies:** For digital technologies intended for use in the NHS, meeting the DTAC standards is increasingly important. While not a formal regulatory approval in the same vein as MHRA registration, it serves as a crucial assessment criterion for procurement. The DTAC process involves the developer completing a questionnaire and providing evidence across the five core areas (clinical safety, data protection, technical security, interoperability, and usability and accessibility). Healthcare organizations use this to assess suitability.\n*   **NICE Evaluation:** The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidance on the use of new and existing medicines and treatments within the NHS through its technology appraisal and medical technologies evaluation programmes. While not a regulatory approval body, a positive NICE recommendation is crucial for widespread adoption and commissioning within the NHS. Innovators interested in NICE evaluation should register their product with the NHS Innovation Service. The timeline for NICE evaluation varies depending on the complexity of the technology and the evidence required.\n\nSpecific timelines for regulatory approval (MHRA) and assessment (DTAC) are not fixed and depend on the complexity of the device, the completeness of the application, and the workload of the regulatory bodies. Funding program timelines are typically outlined in the specific call for applications. For example, SBRI Healthcare Phase 1 projects have a maximum duration of six months.\n\n### Regulatory Contact Information and Resources\n\nInnovators can access support and information regarding regulatory compliance through various channels:\n\n*   **NHS Innovation Service:** Provides guidance and connects innovators with relevant support organizations.\n*   **MHRA:** The primary regulatory body for medical devices and medicines in the UK. Their website provides detailed guidance on regulations, including those specific to software and AI as medical devices.\n*   **Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC):** Information and guidance on DTAC can be found on NHS England websites.\n*   **Health Innovation Networks (HINs):** These networks offer support to innovators, including guidance on navigating the regulatory landscape and accessing funding opportunities.\n*   **NIHR:** Provides information on funding programs like i4i, which may include guidance on regulatory considerations for funded projects.\n\nNavigating the regulatory landscape is an ongoing process. Innovators should engage with relevant bodies and utilize available resources early in the development pathway to ensure their innovation meets the necessary standards for safety, efficacy, and successful adoption within the NHS.", "tool_calls": null}]
