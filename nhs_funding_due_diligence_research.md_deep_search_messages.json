We will need to move away from the historical focus on individual products to categories of innovation and shifts in care, and from looking at a 1 to 2-year horizon for innovation and research to planning for 3, 5 and 10 years ahead.\",\n          \"date\": \"Nov 25, 2024\",\n          \"position\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Harnessing technology and innovation - NHS England\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/next-steps-on-the-nhs-five-year-forward-view/harnessing-technology-and-innovation/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Helping people manage their own health · Digitising hospitals · Technology to support the NHS priorities · Innovation for future care improvement.\",\n          \"position\": 2\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"[PDF] NHS Insights Prioritisation Programme\",\n          \"link\": \"https://thehealthinnovationnetwork.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NIPP-Report_v8.pdf\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Rapid insights into new ways of working post-pandemic\\n\\n\\n\\nThe NHS Insights Prioritisation Programme (NIPP) aimed to identify and test promising innovations that support postpandemic ways of working, build service resilience, and deliver benefits to patients.\\n\\npartnership for a share of a £4.2m fund, to test and evaluate promising innovations within their Integrated Care Systems (ICSs).\\n\\nAn independent evaluation of the programme was carried out between February and May 2023.\\n\\nThe programme was launched in 2021 by NHS England (NHSE) and the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC).\",\n          \"attributes\": {\n            \"Missing\": \"scoring market\"\n          },\n          \"position\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Competition overview - SME support to evaluate innovative medical ...\",\n          \"link\": \"https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/190/overview\",\n          \"snippet\": \"SMEs can apply for a share of £1.5 million to support the evaluation of innovative medical devices, diagnostics and regulated digital health products.\",\n          \"date\": \"Jul 2, 2018\",\n          \"position\": 4\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Background and introduction - NHSBSA\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/nice-technology-appraisals/nice-technology-appraisals-nhs-england-innovation-scorecard-december-2023/background-and-introduction\",\n          \"snippet\": \"The Innovation Scorecard aims to improve transparency within the NHS of what treatments recommended by NICE are available at a local level.\",\n          \"sitelinks\": [\n            {\n              \"title\": \"Background\",\n              \"link\": \"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/nice-technology-appraisals/nice-technology-appraisals-nhs-england-innovation-scorecard-december-2023/background-and-introduction#:~:text=Background,-In%20December%202011%2C%20the\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"title\": \"Introduction\",\n              \"link\": \"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/nice-technology-appraisals/nice-technology-appraisals-nhs-england-innovation-scorecard-december-2023/background-and-introduction#:~:text=Introduction,-The%20Innovation%20Scorecard%20aims%20to\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"title\": \"Main Findings\",\n              \"link\": \"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/nice-technology-appraisals/nice-technology-appraisals-nhs-england-innovation-scorecard-december-2023/background-and-introduction#:~:text=Main%20findings\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"position\": 5\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The previous search provided links for NHS Innovation Service and MedTech Funding Mandate.\nFor NHS Innovation Service: `innovation.nhs.uk` (PageID 2, 4) and `onenhsfinance.nhs.uk` (PageID 3) PDF.\nFor MedTech Funding Mandate: `england.nhs.uk` (PageID 1, 2, 4) and `healthinnovationmanchester.com` (PageID 4).\nFor scoring criteria: `england.nhs.uk` (PageID 1, 2) and `thehealthinnovationnetwork.co.uk` (PageID 3).\n\nI need to:\n1.

The MTFM aims to ensure patients and the NHS benefit from clinically effective and cost saving medical technologies faster and more equitably.Technologies covered by the MTFM are typically funded by commissioners from their existing allocations. This is deliverable as the technologies supported are National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended and meet the criteria to save costs and resources and make a return on investment within three years.\\n\\nNHS England and NICE jointly consulted on building an integrated, rules-based medical technologies (medtech) pathway in July 2024. Together with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NICE, we will update the policies and processes and develop an improved pathway for MedTech. For 2025/26 the MedTech Funding Mandate policy will not be supporting any additional technologies while the Rules Based Pathway for MedTech is being developed.\\n\\nRead the latest guidance here: NHS England » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate policy – guidance for NHS commissioners and providers of NHS-funded care\\n\\n2021/22 marked the first year of the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy, where four technologies were supported. Patients are, on average, now accessing these technologies in over three quarters of eligible providers.During 2021/22, the monthly number of patients accessing Heartflow increased by 35% and over the year, the innovation created over £2.2 million worth of savings for the NHS, bringing the total savings it has generated while under MTFM support to £5 million.\\n\\nGammacore and placental growth factor-based testing both saw their usage rise in 2021/22, with a further 19 trusts adopting Gammacore and eight more offering patients PLGF, despite the removal of national, ring-fenced funding. Gammacore is now offered to patients by 95% of eligible providers.\\n\\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the number of patients accessing SecurAcath rose by 518%, from 1500 to 9270 per month. In 2021/22, the innovation achieved estimated savings of £2.5million.\\n\\nThe MTFM has continued to ensure patients get quicker access to innovative technologies in 2022/23, with 141,895 patients benefitting from use of MTFM supported technologies.**Retired teacher Sue Field, who has been using Apos for a number of years describes how she has benefitted from access to Apos**:\\n\\n“I decided to try Apos treatment because at the age of 55, really wasn’t keen to have knee surgery at that time. Very quickly, even at the first appointment, I found that I was walking without as much pain and without limping and found that my symptoms eased dramatically. I can now walk for many miles without pain in my knees. I’m able to sleep at night and the benefits to my mental health and well-being have been immense.”\\n\\nTo be supported by the MTFM, technologies must meet the policy’s three criteria and align with broader NHS England programmes (for example, Net Zero). These criteria require that technologies:\\n\\nNHS England together with the Heath Innovation Network and NHS Supply Chain continuously assess published NICE guidance to understand which technologies meet this criteria.\\n\\nThe latest technology selected for support in 2024/25 is AposHealth.\\n\\nNHS providers and commissioners are encouraged to review NICE MTG76 and contact NHS Supply Chain to understand the benefits of adopting AposHealth, as well as other MTFM supported technologies.The MTFM will continue supporting the four technologies selected in 2021/22 and the seven selected for support in 2022/23.\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2022/23 were:\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2021/22 were:\\n\\nProposals in a joint NHS England and NICE consultation published in May 2024 set out how establishing a new look MedTech pathway will make it easier still for the most promising clinically and cost-effective technologies to be procured and adopted within the NHS.\\n\\nThe MTFM policy remains in place for 2024/25 and will be reviewed alongside the MedTech pathway consultation. NHS England will continue to assess guidance published by NICE whilst the new pathway is developed.\\n\\nOur FutureNHS collaboration platform contains more information and helpful resources on the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy.\\n\\nPlease email [england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net](mailto:england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net) for any queries and to request access to our FutureNHS platform.Providers wishing to implement MTFM supported technologies should contact their local HIN.\\n\\nInformation on how to procure MTFM supported technologies can be found on NHS Supply Chain’s MedTech Funding Mandate page.\\n\\nVideos available on the HIN YouTube channel, provide an overview of the policy and the financial flow between NHS England, healthcare providers and commissioners.\\n\\nThe Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool was created for health technology innovators and developers in England to help them navigate the different stages involved in getting a new technology adopted into the NHS.\\n\\nThe tool explains the innovation journey through a five-stage process, highlighting the key steps and activities involved at each stage, so that innovators can understand the end-to-end pathway from creation through to product commissioning and monitoring.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England have invested £30 million to support the adoption and acceleration of technologies which can improve patient care in 2024-25. The Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund (HTAAF) was taken up by 41 Integrated Care Systems across the country. The funds will be used to propel innovative medical technology into patients’ care pathways across various areas including: increasing remote and self-monitoring, at home management, speeding up cancer diagnostics and increasing elective capacity as well as clinical productivity. DHSC and NHS England will continue to work with frontline services over the coming year to understand the impact which these funds have had on patients.# Cookies on the NHS England website# Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support## Impact to date## How the policy works## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2024/25## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2021/22 and 2022/23## Medical technology (MedTech) pathway consultation## Additional information## Introducing the Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool## Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund\\n\\nNHS Accelerated Access Collaborative » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support\\n----------------\\nEnd of this webpage.

Key partners in the IEP must collaborate in the coming months to plan the delivery of the recommendations. The forthcoming 10-Year Health Plan, Innovation and Adoption Strategy, and Life Sciences Sector Plan present a vital opportunity to embed these recommendations into national long-term strategies. However, progress should not wait for these developments. Immediate action and discussions are needed to prioritise and implement key steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Innovation, research and life sciences offers the opportunity to significantly enhance patient outcomes and benefit the UK economy and society. Today’s report spotlights the potential of emerging technologies, world leading research and life sciences to better enable the NHS to innovate, make new discoveries and deliver more personalised services and it sets out what needs to be done to ensure the NHS, scientists, industry and innovators have effective partnerships and seize these opportunities.”\\n\\nVin Diwakar interim National Director of Transformation, NHS EnglandThe recommendations set out practical changes to evolve the innovation ecosystem, enabling the NHS to meet future healthcare needs through testing, adoption, and scaling of innovations for patients and staff. They should be implemented as a cohesive package, as no single solution can create a thriving ecosystem. Prioritisation and clear delivery plans will be essential, requiring action from all partners. The key message is clear: collaboration, alignment, and shared effort are vital to achieve these goals and better serve patients and the public.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStructures and tools for delivery\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople, skills and capabilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe NHS faces a pivotal moment of risk and opportunity and there is an urgent need to act.\\n\\nThe NHS faces significant challenges, including workforce pressures and rising care demands, but has unmatched potential to lead in healthcare innovation. By leveraging its life sciences sector and rich health data, it can transform patient outcomes and the UK economy, provided decisive action is taken at all levels to overcome barriers.\\n\\nThe Innovation Ecosystem Programme was given a mandate to foster collaboration between the NHS and key stakeholders.The Chief Executive of NHS England tasked the IEP with fostering collaboration between the NHS, industry, academia, and regulators to streamline healthcare innovation. Our recommendations stem from analysis of extensive engagement – hundreds of interviews, roundtables and working group discussions – through 4 targeted workstreams led by the chief executives and chairs of many of the key organisations in the life sciences ecosystem.\\n\\n“New technologies are changing the world we live in at a blistering pace, and patients rightly expect the NHS to harness the best of this to improve the care on offer to communities up and down the country. To unlock the true power of innovation and to fix the most pressing health challenges facing us as a society, it is vital that patients and the public play a leading role in both identifying the problems and co-designing the solutions... It has been a real pleasure sharing insights from our members into this work. It is only through equal partnership between clinicians, industry, patients and the voluntary sector that can we ensure everyone benefits and we build a genuinely equitable future for the NHS.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJacob Lant, Chief Executive of National Voices, England’s leading coalition of over 200 independent health and social care charitiesThe population aged 85 and over, comprising 1.6 million (2%) in 2016, is projected to double to 3.2 million $\\\\\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\mathbb{G}$ by 2041 and treble to 5.1 million (7%) by 2066.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrioritise and co-ordinate innovation around the shifts and goals for health\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment and the NHS should send a clear signal that innovation and working with industry is a core part of how the NHS delivers care, alongside education and research. The NHS 10-Year Health Plan and the Innovation and Adoption Strategy should set direction on the importance of innovation in achieving the NHS’s goals both in terms of improving the nation’s health and driving economic growth.Throughout developing this report, we have heard of the need to balance top-down direction and local flexibility on delivery. Therefore, major localities need to come forward to lead and show a willingness to partner on national priorities; specifically, to develop best practice for delivering transformation and the adoption of innovation, and to share learning across the system.\\n\\n“…the NHS, government, industry and academia should work together to mobilise major geographies behind the key priorities now.”\\n\\nWhere agreed, these localities will be tasked with accelerating progress on the nationally designated innovation priorities.\\n\\nfuture investment in innovation and adoption, by working with national teams to articulate the benefits from supporting the design, development and deployment of innovation\\n\\n\\n\\nThe recommendations in this report set out the practical changes needed to evolve the ecosystem to meet the needs of the future through testing, adopting and scaling innovation for the benefit of patients and staff; and to support economic growth. They represent a complex, ambitious programme of work. We are aware that some of the recommendations are starting to be addressed, while others will need further development and agreement before implementation.The NHS cannot make these changes alone. The key message from the Innovation Ecosystem Programme (IEP) to all partners is to collaborate, prioritise and align to better meet the needs of patients and the public.\\n\\nThis report marks the end of this phase of our work together, but there is still more to do. The key partners in the IEP alongside other relevant programmes within NHS England and DHSC should come together over the next few months to agree when and how we want to deliver. The forthcoming 10-Year Health Plan, Innovation and Adoption Strategy and Life Sciences Sector Plan offer an opportunity to respond to and implement the recommendations from our programme in national longterm strategies and provide an even firmer grounding for these reforms in support of the wider ambitions for health and care the plan will set out.\\n\\nBut the development of the 10-Year Health Plan should not stop us from getting on with making progress now.\\n\\nThe forthcoming 10-Year Health Plan, Innovation and Adoption Strategy, and Life Sciences Sector Plan present a vital opportunity to embed these recommendations into national long-term strategies.\\n\\nWe welcome further discussion on where we should focus immediate action, but this must include:Embedding recommendations Feeding the report’s recommendations into the wider national plans and strategy\\n\\nThe 10-Year Health Plan, Innovation and Adoption Strategy and Life Sciences Sector Plan provide the opportunity to set a clear signal of the importance of innovation to the NHS and the role it can play in supporting the government’s health and economic growth missions. The development of these documents should build on the IEP’s recommendations set out in this report and be the vehicle to set a clear long-term plan for delivery. They should also consider whether we can and should go further, setting a bigger ambition for how innovation can support the transformation of the NHS. The stakeholders and partners we engaged with are ready to contribute to the development of these documents.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgreeing the national priorities and beginning the work to align innovation activity and funding behind them\\n\\nUltimately given the challenges facing the NHS, the limited government funds available and agendas of different stakeholders, there are likely to need to be trade-offs in the implementation of the recommendations. These are most likely to be around:of innovation ·how widespread and quickly the NHS can address the structural and capability recommendations, and how it balances the focus on advancing the ‘acceleration’ proposals versus building universal capacity innovation, and the order and priority with which they are addressed\\n\\nThese trade-offs can best be made by continuing the collective conversation across all stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnhancing our cross-organisational governance, alignment and funding and using this mechanism to make trade-offs as to the focus and pace of innovation adoption\\n\\nThe IEP programme benefitted from the engagement with many leaders and stakeholders who support the testing and adoption of innovation. This engagement must continue through our governance forums, which should be enhanced and given clear authority to drive delivery and direct spend but with transparency over partner actions. We also need to consider their membership – to ensure voices from within NHS systems are represented in the delivery of the recommendations and held responsible.\\n\\nStarting ‘acceleration’ in a set of geographies to further refine recommendations and to start to make progressGiven the existing capabilities and networks in the UK, it will be possible to move forward within existing budgets and plans with the acceleration phase of this work, testing out some of the recommendations and further refining them for broader role out. This will allow progress to be made and maintain momentum, as well as helping to inform longer term planning.\\n\\nThis case study highlights a solution to the challenge of delivering efficient remote care in the NHS, particularly amidst rising demand for clinical services and the need for effective patient monitoring.\\n\\nIsla is a digital pathway platform that enables clinical teams to implement highly automated and efficient digital pathways using secure submission of multimedia and clinical data. Integrated into NHS technologies and used across acute, community and mental health care to support triage, caseload management, self-care and specific pathways like epilepsy, Isla can streamline clinical decisionmaking and enhances care delivery across specialties – significantly reducing the need for follow-up appointments and hospital readmissions.

Many healthcare systems wish to foster transparency and accountability in the decisions they make by incorporating the public in decision-making processes. This paper presents a unique conceptual approach exploring the public’s preferences for health service innovations by viewing healthcare innovations as ‘bundles’ of characteristics. This decompositional approach allows policy-makers to compare numerous competing health service innovations without repeatedly administering surveys for specific innovation choices.\\n\\nA Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to elicit preferences. Individuals chose from presented innovation options that they believe the UK National Health Service (NHS) should invest the most in. Innovations differed according to: (i) target population; (ii) target age; (iii) implementation time; (iv) uncertainty associated with their likely effects; (v) potential health benefits; and, (vi) cost to a taxpayer. This approach fosters multidimensional decision-making, rather than imposing a single decision criterion (e.g., cost, target age) in prioritisation. Choice data was then analysed using scale-adjusted Latent Class models to investigate variability in preferences and scale and valuations amongst respondents.Three latent classes with considerable heterogeneity in the preferences were present. Each latent class is composed of two consumer subgroups varying in the level of certainty in their choices. All groups preferred scientifically proven innovations, those with potential health benefits that cost less. There were, however, some important differences in their preferences for innovation investment choices: Class-1 (54%) prefers innovations benefitting adults and young people and does not prefer innovations targeting people with ‘drug addiction’ and ‘obesity’. Class- 2 (34%) prefers innovations targeting ‘cancer’ patients only and has negative preferences for innovations targeting elderly, and Class-3 (12%) prefers spending on elderly and cancer patients the most.\\n\\nDCE can help policy-makers incorporate public preferences for health service innovation investment choices into decision making. The findings provide useful information on the public’s valuation and acceptability of potential health service innovations. Such information can be used to guide innovation prioritisation decisions by comparing competing innovation options. The approach in this paper makes, these often implicit and opaque decisions, more transparent and explicit.Innovations – products, practices, methods or services that are perceived as “new” by adopters and potential users \\\\ [1\\\\] – come in various forms. In systems where the number of innovations that can be implemented outstrips scarce resources, prioritisation surrounding which health service innovations receive resources is inevitable \\\\ [2, 3\\\\]. Alongside the use of economic criteria (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-utility), other factors, such as ease of implementation, severity of disease, and political acceptability \\\\ [4\\\\] are also used in the prioritisation of health service innovations, often implicitly. Recently, health systems have sought to incorporate public preferences in priority setting and investment decisions \\\\ [5– 9\\\\].Studies examining the public’s priorities for spending on healthcare often focus on criteria such as ‘severity of illness’ \\\\ [10, 11\\\\] ‘age’ \\\\ [12\\\\], and ‘value for money’ \\\\ [10\\\\]. Often these criteria are viewed in isolation from each other. In this paper, we start from a descriptive position that innovation investment prioritisation decisions are complex and a normative position that they should be based on multiple criteria; in doing so, we propose a means of identifying the importance attached to such criteria. We use the term ‘characteristic’ to represent such criteria. Every innovation has several such characteristics: how much it costs, the health benefits likely to result from implementation, the population targeted or most affected. In this paper, we explore the acceptability of (and importance attached to) health service innovations and their characteristics from a social perspective. We aim to explain how valuation of innovation characteristics can be meaningfully used as a guide for prioritisation and innovation investment. Crucially, we want to fill one of the important gaps in the innovation implementation literature: how the public feel about potential choices made on their behalf.Our methodological approach, Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE), involves viewing healthcare innovations as ‘bundles’ of characteristics (e.g., their cost, how long they take to implement, and their likely impact on health), which allows us to study a wide range of innovations sharing the same characteristics (e.g., cost), but at different levels (e.g., £10, £20), without specifying exactly what these innovations are. By using this broader framework, we aim to help policy-makers and other decision-makers in prioritising the innovation investment choices available to them. Additionally, whilst DCE is receiving growing attention in health economics \\\\ [13– 16\\\\], its use in an implementation (of innovations) context is sparse \\\\ [10, 11, 13\\\\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to explore public preferences for health service innovation investment options.The Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) is a technique for eliciting individuals’ preferences. It is commonly used in environmental economics \\\\ [17– 19\\\\] and transportation \\\\ [20– 22\\\\] for prioritisation decisions using public preferences. Health economists have begun to see the benefit of the approach for helping answer a wide range of policy questions \\\\ [13, 23\\\\], including priority setting frameworks \\\\ [2, 10, 24– 27\\\\].\\n\\nDCE involves asking respondents to choose between competing (hypothetical) innovations, presented as scenarios, using a series of defined characteristics (or attributes) represented at various levels (e.g., an attribute of ‘financial cost’ at the level of ‘£10’). Using the choice data, the relative importance of specific, plausible scenarios, and the values individuals attach to their constituent parts (i.e., willingness-to-pay) are estimated via probabilistic choice models \\\\ [28, 29\\\\].Attributes and their associated levels were identified from literature reviews and policy documents (e.g., NICE \\\\ [30\\\\]), interviews with Foundation Trust managers and Trust members, and a focus group discussion with non-academic staff in Yorka. Innovation characteristics from these sources were compiled and refined using interviews with managers from a large NHS Foundation Trust. The final selection of characteristics to be used in the survey is based on the focus group discussions and discussions with managers from a NHS Foundation Trust. As a result, we used six health service innovation attributes in the surveys: (i) target population; (ii) age group; (iii) time to get into practice; (iv) whether it works; (v) potential health benefits; and, (vi) cost to an individual taxpayer. The detailed descriptions are presented in Table 1. The survey attributes, the number of choice tasks, and survey question framing were further tested using two pilot surveysb. The pilot surveys yielded data that could be used to identify confusions, lack of understanding, and the time needed to complete the survey. They also tested the framing of the information, which is provided to respondents before they took the survey, about innovations, innovation characteristics and levels. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Ethicsand Governance Committee of the University of York.**Health service innovation attributes and levels**\\n\\nVarious reasons lay behind the final selection of these attributes. Different health issues differentially impact on certain population and age groups. Thus, expressed need with potential for improved health between groups may also be different \\\\ [31\\\\]; as will their capacity to benefit \\\\ [30\\\\], p.47\\\\]. Age is a contentious decision criterion for health service prioritisation \\\\ [32– 34\\\\]. We included ‘age’ to investigate whether, as is often assumed rather than established, there are systematic differences in the public’s preferences for innovations targeting certain age groups.\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The previous browsing attempt for NIHR i4i and AI Award application guidance failed due to temporary errors.

Many healthcare systems wish to foster transparency and accountability in the decisions they make by incorporating the public in decision-making processes. This paper presents a unique conceptual approach exploring the public’s preferences for health service innovations by viewing healthcare innovations as ‘bundles’ of characteristics.

The NHS and its partners will need to be less ‘supply side’ in how they identify innovation, instead prioritising innovation and research support for areas of greatest need, aligned to the government’s health and economic growth missions. We will need to move away from the historical focus on individual products to categories of innovation and shifts in care, and from looking at a 1 to 2-year horizon for innovation and research to planning for 3, 5 and 10 years ahead.\",\n          \"date\": \"Nov 25, 2024\",\n          \"position\": 2\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"[PDF] Health Innovation Network Impact Report 2023-24\",\n          \"link\": \"https://thehealthinnovationnetwork.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Health-Innovation-Network-Impact-Report-2023_2024-VFinal-1.pdf\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Our cross-cutting themes mirror the NHS national priorities and act as the foundation for the work we do: improving productivity, involving patients, and ...\",\n          \"attributes\": {\n            \"Missing\": \"criteria | Show results with:criteria\"\n          },\n          \"position\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"[PDF] 2023/24 priorities and operational planning guidance - NHS England\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PRN00021-23-24-priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-v1.1.pdf\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Systems should review workforce growth by staff group and identify expected productivity increases in line with the growth seen. • Increase theatre productivity ...\",\n          \"position\": 4\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"[PDF] strategy 2024-2029 - Health Innovation West of England\",\n          \"link\": \"https://www.healthinnowest.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Health-Innovation-West-Strategy-2024-2029-FINAL.pdf\",\n          \"snippet\": \"Facilitate and grow local networks.
