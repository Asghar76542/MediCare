External organisations include\\n\\n Charities (including the Trust Charity),\\n\\n Commercial organisations,\\n\\n National funding bodies (including the National Institute for Health Research) and Individual funders.\\n\\nGrant applications involve considerable amount of effort and support is available from the Research and Development (R&D) Office. Please work with the Research and Development Office from an early stage as this will make it easier for you.Before you can submit your grant application you will need to undertake the following two step process:  Step 1 - an initial registration of intent (as soon as you know you might wish to submit a grant application),  Step 2 - the final pre-submission approval, before you can actually submit Both Step 1 and Step 2 forms to be sent to the generic email [Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net](mailto:Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net).\\n\\nWhen you have an idea for research use the Research Grant Application Checklist (Appendix 1) to help you think about whether you want to seek external funding and how to access support via the East of England Research Design Services (see Appendix 2).\\n\\nIf you want to prepare an application for funding then it will need to be costed to ensure that the relevant costs are included in the grant application. You need to contact the Research and Development Manager as soon as possible as costing is a complex and lengthy process. If you are seeking Sponsorship then include the costs for this and see the separate “Guidance Note on the process to be followed when requesting the Trust to act as Research Sponsor”.The proposed research is likely to have a number of implications which need to be assessed before you submit your grant application, including:\\n\\na. research governance and financial – please discuss with the R&D Manager.\\n\\nb. research support - these will need to be reviewed by the Lead Research Nurse and the R&D Manager\\n\\nc. service delivery impact – please ensure that this has been assessed and you have agreement from the relevant service manager within your department. Once you have submitted your initial registration of intent you will be sent the relevant guidance notes and contact details. Unfortunately the Associate Director of R&D cannot approve your application unless it has prior authorisation form the R&D manager and the Lead Research Nurse.\\n\\nThe final grant application will need to be authorised by the Trust via the signature of the Associate Director of Research and Development. Please request this (step 2 form) and allow 2 weeks between your request and receiving a signature.\\n\\nUnauthorised applications may not be appropriately costed and the Trust may not support the research even if the grant is successfulThe applicant must notify the Research Office of the outcome of the award within 2 weeks of receipt of notification from the funding body by sending an email to [Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net](mailto:Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net).\\n\\nThe Associate Director of Research and Development requires 2 weeks to review all applications and that they will only be considered if they have prior approval of the Lead Research Nurse, the Research Development Manager and Clinical Director as evidenced via the form in Appendix 3.\\n\\nYou may get a research idea at any stage and wonder what to do with it - the following may help. You will need to do a literature (background) search to find out what other research has been done in similar areas, or if the idea is for a new product/device, to find out what is already available. Talk to colleagues about your idea - do they think it's worth doing? Patient and public involvement is needed for grant applications, and will need to be developed more as your application progresses. Think about whom you can collaborate with - if you are inexperienced in research, you will need to collaborate with more experienced people - these may be within or outside of the Trust. Write down your ideas. Help is available, but if you want to be successful in research you will need to learn the skill of writing good applications. Think about who you will need to involve, and what you will need (funding, equipment) If your idea is for a new device/product, do not talk to any commercial companies without first discussing with the Associate Director of Research and Development [Phillip.smith5@nhs.net](mailto:Phillip.smith5@nhs.net)\\n\\n It takes time to develop a good application, and only the very best get funded. You will need the right team in order to carry out any research; this is one of the key things funders look for.\\n\\n Start small; there are local funding schemes available that allow you to undertake preliminary or feasibility work, or to backfill clinical time. If you have an idea for a larger (and expensive) study, you will need to talk to experienced colleagues and get their help and advice. People who succeed are those who take time to prepare the application, get the right people involved (relevant expertise) and have regular team meetings to discuss the project. You should not be the only person to have seen your idea before applying for funding.\\n\\nTalk to colleagues and the clinical teams in your department. You will need their support in order to carry out any research.Contact the East of England Research Design Service (RDS) for methodological support in developing NIHR and some other applications is available via East of England Research Design Service. You may approach the RDS at any stage of development of a research proposal: from simply wanting to discuss an initial idea through to requesting input on a specific issue relating to a well-developed proposal. The earlier you approach them, the more comprehensive their advice can be. They prefer you to make an initial on-line request for support via their website: www.rds-eoe.nihr.ac.uk. You may, however, also make contact in person, telephone, email or post.\\n\\nNational Guidance “Attributing the costs of health and social care research “has been produced which describes how research in the NHS is funded via three streams (given below). This is complex and specialist advice from the Research Office is recommended. Research Costs - the costs of the R&D itself that end when the research ends. They relate to activities that are being undertaken to answer the research questions. NHS Treatment Costs - the patient care costs, which would continue to be incurred if the patient care service in question continued to be provided after the R&D study had stopped. NHS Support Costs - the additional patient care costs associated with the research, which would end once the R&D study in question had stopped, even if the patient care involved continued to be provided. As a Trust we will work with the NIHR CRN: Eastern Study Support lead to ensure that the types of research support funding are calculated and attributed in accordance with national guidance.\\n\\n Scope The RDS is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to assist researchers preparing research proposals for submission to national, peer-reviewed funding competitions for applied health or social care research. Priority will be given to supporting proposals to be submitted to an NIHR scheme. Nature of support provided RDS staff have the knowledge and expertise to advise on a wide range of research-related issues, including in particular all aspects of research design and methodology. We can also advise on issues such as involving patients and public, identifying resources and dissemination plans. Although one RDS adviser will take the lead in coordinating support, other RDS staff may become involved to bring complementary skills, and we have a wide range of other contacts in academic and clinical disciplines to facilitate any necessary additional input where required. Eligibility We provide support to NHS, social care researchers and other researchers who are working in partnership with the NHS. RDS services are free of charge, but it is useful to give some examples of situations where we are not able to provide support free of charge:\\n\\no the development of projects for which there is no intention to submit a grant application to a recognised funder as described above\\n\\no doing the research; if required this would need to be costed into the project grant bid, and it would also depend upon available research capacity and interests of host institution\\n\\no formal supervision or informal support for students\\n\\no requesting support to conduct unfunded analysis on data already collected.$\\\\\\\\bigcirc$ It should also be noted that it is only within RDS remit to support applications to national peerreviewed funding agencies.\\n\\nMutual Understandings You can expect to gain access to a professional service in a timely manner. If eligible, you can expect the following from the RDS:\\n\\no professional advice about aspects of developing a grant application and practical support for such development, free of charge; advice will be given to all projects that have potential to achieve funding and advice will be provided throughout the submission process\\n\\no face-to-face meetings at a mutually convenient time and venue and/or other forms of communication as appropriate\\n\\no support in co-ordinating the process of proposal development, as required\\n\\no advice on drafting relevant sections of proposals, as required\\n\\no support in identifying and approaching other potential lay and professional collaborators, as required\\n\\no support in identifying a suitable NIHR funding stream and advising on their application processes; if not eligible for NIHR funding we would try to provide advice on other potential funding bodies depending on local knowledge\\n\\no support for obtaining appropriate user and carer involvement in project development\\n\\n$\\\\\\\\bigcirc$ in the case of unsuccessful applications, support with deciding what to do next\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The browsing of the NHS document (enherts-tr.nhs.uk) was partially successful.

Work should be aligned to both local and national objectives together with structured plans to measure improvements.Very often, it is clear that we need to get on and improve things and you may be tempted to leap in and do so. However, a very high proportion of projects fail, and one way to increase the chances of your own project succeeding is to adopt a more systematic, tried and tested approach such as those outlined on this page. Quality improvement requires the will, the ideas and the execution of those ideas to succeed – very often, we have the will to make things happen, but by using models such as these, we can ensure we develop the best possible change ideas and approach implementation in a planned and systematic way to enhance our chances of success.\\n\\nA five step improvement approach has been defined to provide a systematic framework from the beginning to the end of your improvement project which will give your project a greater chance of sustainable success.\\n\\n• Preparation • Launch • Diagnosis • Implementation • Evaluation\\n\\nThe launch phase is the official start of the project. The team should be formed; project plans, communication plans and data collection plans should be in place and an executive sponsor identified to support the project.\\n\\nThe diagnosis phase is about understanding the current process, dispelling assumptions, using data to define the problem and to build upon the baseline data.The preparation phase incorporates everything you need to do before the official start of your project. This includes defining your project aims and objectives, collecting baseline data for your service,\\n\\nThe implementation phase tests and measures potential solutions using a plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycle (chapter 9), implements the best solution and introduces standard work and mistake proofing for a quality sustainable process.\\n\\nThe final phase is evaluation where achievements are celebrated, learning and principles are captured and the improvement becomes the norm.\\n\\nWhat are we trying to accomplish?\\n\\nHow will we know that a change is an improvement?\\n\\nWhat changes can we make that will result in the improvements that we seek?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sum of all of the change ideas that are tested and successfully implemented will be the effective redesign of processes or ways of working.\\n\\nThe framework, which was developed by a team at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in the USA, includes three key questions to ask before embarking on a change programme, supported by a process for testing change ideas using plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles.\\n\\n• Clear and focused goals that focus on problems that cause concern for patients and staff\\n\\n• Consistent with local and national outcomes, plans and frameworks• Bold and aspirational\\n\\n• With clear numerical targets.\\n\\n• Measure regularly during testing – what is the impact immediately, and what is the impact over a period of time? • Continue to measure after the improvement is implemented, to ensure that the change is sustained.\\n\\n• Many change ideas are generated at process mapping events (See Chapter 8) • Use techniques of creative thinking and innovation to generate ideas and to sort them into those to be tested • Learn from your colleagues – we know that there are many examples of good practice currently available.\\n\\nThe model for improvement is incorporated into the five step approach and was designed to provide a framework for developing, testing and implementing changes that lead to improvement. To achieve improvements we need to take the time to plan change and test it out and resist the temptation to rush into wholesale changes to systems. This way, we will know what is working well, and what is not so successful. Small scale changes can be undone and replaced by alternative ideas.\\n\\n• What can we measure that will change if the system is improved?\\n\\n• How can we obtain this data? Is it available in existing information systems, or will we need to collect this manually?\\\"Oh, no! The elephant is like a snake\\\" said the second man who felt the trunk.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no! It is like a rope,\\\" said the third man who touched the tail.\\n\\n\\\"It is like a brush\\\" said the fourth man who rubbed the elephant ear.\\n\\nAnd the fifth man said \\\"It’s soft and mushy…\\\"\\n\\nThey began to argue about the elephant and they all insisted they were right. They all were right in what they were saying as they had all developed an understanding based on their own experiences and perspective. However, they did not have an understanding of the whole elephant.\\n\\n\\n\\nImagine the elephant to be a patient. Different clinicians and health care staff see the patient in different ways, all of them correct, but by not seeing the whole patient pathway, their understanding is limited. Make sure you understand the entire process/patient pathway before starting any improvement project.\\n\\n\\n\\nStarting out on any improvement project is an exciting time, and you are likely to be full of enthusiasm and optimism. However, things don’t always go entirely to plan and it can be hard to maintain impetus and progress with enthusiasm alone.For a project to be successful, it is important that an adequate amount of time is spent on managing the project.\\n\\nSpending time getting the preparatory work right first time will be beneficial later in the project. Preparatory work includes:\\n\\n• Getting the right team (Chapter 5)\\n\\n• Having a good relationship with your executive sponsor (Chapter 5)\\n\\n• Having a solid project plan (Chapter 3)\\n\\n• Having a robust communication plan (Chapter 7)\\n\\n• Understanding the current service (Chapter 2 and 8)\\n\\n• Collecting baseline data and having a data collection plan (Chapter 10 and 11) • Understanding your customer requirements (Chapter 6).A project plan is fundamental to the establishment of the project. It sets the contract for improvement and establishes the mandate, priorities and resource availability. In other words, it spells out clearly what, how and when is to be done, so that everyone is aware of their commitments and how they will impact on the project’s success. It can be tempting to ignore this element as ‘bureaucratic’ or ‘administrative’, but it is an essential tool for ensuring there is clarity about the project and that expectations are managed. This need not be an onerous process, but the plan does need to clearly spell out the key areas.\\n\\nGetting the right people involved from the start of the project\\n\\nHaving a clear aims statement\\n\\nPlanning, monitoring and control\\n\\nHaving a real understanding of\\n\\nthe current issue or problem\\n\\nMeasurable improvements\\n\\nwhich are achievements not just activities\\n\\nHaving clear links to local and national objectives i.e. a clear\\n\\nreason to do it\\n\\n• Involving patients and carers,\\n\\n(ideally) from the beginning\\n\\nDisplaying effective communication.The plan is developed in the preparation phase of the project and enables decisions to be made with regard to modifying or cancelling the initiative in situations where the required support for the project either changes or is lacking. The plan is used throughout the project for monitoring and control.\\n\\n• Aims and objectives\\n\\n• Background to the project\\n\\n• Scope of project\\n\\n• Expected deliverables\\n\\n• Timescale\\n\\n• Analysis of risk\\n\\n• Resources\\n\\n• Budget\\n\\n• Method/process\\n\\n• Accountability\\n\\n• Identification of the project sponsor • Data and measures\\n\\n• Dependencies (i.e. links between one action and another)\\n\\n• How the work is going to be sustained and spread to other areas.\\n\\nProject plans come in many different styles, but each should set out all the actions that have to occur to achieve the improvement, as well as clearly stating when these will happen and who is responsible for doing them.\\n\\nA project is a temporary piece of work with a defined start and finish, and will not continue indefinitely. Project work is also designed to deliver a defined outcome or benefit from doing the work.• Project aims and objectives not clearly defined or articulated Little or no top level support and leadership for the project • Lack of effective engagement with key players and patients • Poorly planned projects • Inadequately monitored, controlled and managed • Failure to take account of local and national priorities • Poor communication • Failure to divide the project into small manageable tasks • Unable to collect and analyse data.\\n\\nYes, within the project team, someone needs to be responsible for the role. Without someone to undertake this role, it is unlikely that even the smallest project team will deliver what it sets out to achieve within the agreed parameters.\\n\\nGood project management is not just bureaucracy. It is about ensuring there is consistent co-ordination, drive and evaluation of the project so that it remains focused and effective. Not having someone to manage the project usually means that no one takes overall responsibility for ensuring that all the components are being delivered – and the project may then falter or fail.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.enherts-tr.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Submitting-Grant-Applications-v3-dated-20th-July-2018.pdf\",\n    \"query\": \"supporting documents required for NHS grant applications\",\n    \"content\": \"The purpose of this document is to describe the process to be followed by Trust staff wishing to submit an application for external funding of a research study i.e. a grant application. This is to ensure that the Trust is aware of all external funding applications for research, that staff can be supported in developing their grant application and that the resources have been adequately considered in the application. External organisations include\\n\\n Charities (including the Trust Charity),\\n\\n Commercial organisations,\\n\\n National funding bodies (including the National Institute for Health Research) and Individual funders.\\n\\nGrant applications involve considerable amount of effort and support is available from the Research and Development (R&D) Office. Please work with the Research and Development Office from an early stage as this will make it easier for you.Before you can submit your grant application you will need to undertake the following two step process:  Step 1 - an initial registration of intent (as soon as you know you might wish to submit a grant application),  Step 2 - the final pre-submission approval, before you can actually submit Both Step 1 and Step 2 forms to be sent to the generic email [Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net](mailto:Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net).\\n\\nWhen you have an idea for research use the Research Grant Application Checklist (Appendix 1) to help you think about whether you want to seek external funding and how to access support via the East of England Research Design Services (see Appendix 2).\\n\\nIf you want to prepare an application for funding then it will need to be costed to ensure that the relevant costs are included in the grant application. You need to contact the Research and Development Manager as soon as possible as costing is a complex and lengthy process. If you are seeking Sponsorship then include the costs for this and see the separate “Guidance Note on the process to be followed when requesting the Trust to act as Research Sponsor”.The proposed research is likely to have a number of implications which need to be assessed before you submit your grant application, including:\\n\\na. research governance and financial – please discuss with the R&D Manager.\\n\\nb. research support - these will need to be reviewed by the Lead Research Nurse and the R&D Manager\\n\\nc. service delivery impact – please ensure that this has been assessed and you have agreement from the relevant service manager within your department. Once you have submitted your initial registration of intent you will be sent the relevant guidance notes and contact details. Unfortunately the Associate Director of R&D cannot approve your application unless it has prior authorisation form the R&D manager and the Lead Research Nurse.\\n\\nThe final grant application will need to be authorised by the Trust via the signature of the Associate Director of Research and Development. Please request this (step 2 form) and allow 2 weeks between your request and receiving a signature.\\n\\nUnauthorised applications may not be appropriately costed and the Trust may not support the research even if the grant is successfulThe applicant must notify the Research Office of the outcome of the award within 2 weeks of receipt of notification from the funding body by sending an email to [Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net](mailto:Grantapplications.enh-tr@nhs.net).\\n\\nThe Associate Director of Research and Development requires 2 weeks to review all applications and that they will only be considered if they have prior approval of the Lead Research Nurse, the Research Development Manager and Clinical Director as evidenced via the form in Appendix 3.\\n\\nYou may get a research idea at any stage and wonder what to do with it - the following may help. You will need to do a literature (background) search to find out what other research has been done in similar areas, or if the idea is for a new product/device, to find out what is already available. Talk to colleagues about your idea - do they think it's worth doing? Patient and public involvement is needed for grant applications, and will need to be developed more as your application progresses. Think about whom you can collaborate with - if you are inexperienced in research, you will need to collaborate with more experienced people - these may be within or outside of the Trust. Write down your ideas. Help is available, but if you want to be successful in research you will need to learn the skill of writing good applications. Think about who you will need to involve, and what you will need (funding, equipment) If your idea is for a new device/product, do not talk to any commercial companies without first discussing with the Associate Director of Research and Development [Phillip.smith5@nhs.net](mailto:Phillip.smith5@nhs.net)\\n\\n It takes time to develop a good application, and only the very best get funded. You will need the right team in order to carry out any research; this is one of the key things funders look for.\\n\\n Start small; there are local funding schemes available that allow you to undertake preliminary or feasibility work, or to backfill clinical time. If you have an idea for a larger (and expensive) study, you will need to talk to experienced colleagues and get their help and advice. People who succeed are those who take time to prepare the application, get the right people involved (relevant expertise) and have regular team meetings to discuss the project. You should not be the only person to have seen your idea before applying for funding.\\n\\nTalk to colleagues and the clinical teams in your department. You will need their support in order to carry out any research.Contact the East of England Research Design Service (RDS) for methodological support in developing NIHR and some other applications is available via East of England Research Design Service. You may approach the RDS at any stage of development of a research proposal: from simply wanting to discuss an initial idea through to requesting input on a specific issue relating to a well-developed proposal. The earlier you approach them, the more comprehensive their advice can be. They prefer you to make an initial on-line request for support via their website: www.rds-eoe.nihr.ac.uk. You may, however, also make contact in person, telephone, email or post.\\n\\nNational Guidance “Attributing the costs of health and social care research “has been produced which describes how research in the NHS is funded via three streams (given below). This is complex and specialist advice from the Research Office is recommended. Research Costs - the costs of the R&D itself that end when the research ends. They relate to activities that are being undertaken to answer the research questions. NHS Treatment Costs - the patient care costs, which would continue to be incurred if the patient care service in question continued to be provided after the R&D study had stopped. NHS Support Costs - the additional patient care costs associated with the research, which would end once the R&D study in question had stopped, even if the patient care involved continued to be provided. As a Trust we will work with the NIHR CRN: Eastern Study Support lead to ensure that the types of research support funding are calculated and attributed in accordance with national guidance.\\n\\n Scope The RDS is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to assist researchers preparing research proposals for submission to national, peer-reviewed funding competitions for applied health or social care research. Priority will be given to supporting proposals to be submitted to an NIHR scheme. Nature of support provided RDS staff have the knowledge and expertise to advise on a wide range of research-related issues, including in particular all aspects of research design and methodology. We can also advise on issues such as involving patients and public, identifying resources and dissemination plans. Although one RDS adviser will take the lead in coordinating support, other RDS staff may become involved to bring complementary skills, and we have a wide range of other contacts in academic and clinical disciplines to facilitate any necessary additional input where required. Eligibility We provide support to NHS, social care researchers and other researchers who are working in partnership with the NHS. RDS services are free of charge, but it is useful to give some examples of situations where we are not able to provide support free of charge:\\n\\no the development of projects for which there is no intention to submit a grant application to a recognised funder as described above\\n\\no doing the research; if required this would need to be costed into the project grant bid, and it would also depend upon available research capacity and interests of host institution\\n\\no formal supervision or informal support for students\\n\\no requesting support to conduct unfunded analysis on data already collected.$\\\\\\\\bigcirc$ It should also be noted that it is only within RDS remit to support applications to national peerreviewed funding agencies.\\n\\nMutual Understandings You can expect to gain access to a professional service in a timely manner. If eligible, you can expect the following from the RDS:\\n\\no professional advice about aspects of developing a grant application and practical support for such development, free of charge; advice will be given to all projects that have potential to achieve funding and advice will be provided throughout the submission process\\n\\no face-to-face meetings at a mutually convenient time and venue and/or other forms of communication as appropriate\\n\\no support in co-ordinating the process of proposal development, as required\\n\\no advice on drafting relevant sections of proposals, as required\\n\\no support in identifying and approaching other potential lay and professional collaborators, as required\\n\\no support in identifying a suitable NIHR funding stream and advising on their application processes; if not eligible for NIHR funding we would try to provide advice on other potential funding bodies depending on local knowledge\\n\\no support for obtaining appropriate user and carer involvement in project development\\n\\n$\\\\\\\\bigcirc$ in the case of unsuccessful applications, support with deciding what to do next\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Starting to generate the final answer.
