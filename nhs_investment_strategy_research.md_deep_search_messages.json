The NHS spends £10 billion a year on medtech including syringes, wheelchairs, cardiac pacemakers and medical imaging equipment such as X-ray machines.\\n\\nBuilding on learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid development of medical technologies during that time such as lateral flow tests and ventilators, this strategy will ensure the right product is available at the right price and in the right place. As a result, patients will continue to have access to high-quality care, alongside improved patient safety and health outcomes.\\n\\nThe strategy aims to deliver value for money, using the latest data on the effectiveness of new technology to ensure prices are reasonable for the health system. It will also help build resilient supply chains and ensure the UK is prepared for future pandemics, just as demand for technology like syringes and ventilators rapidly increase during the pandemic.Using medtech effectively will be critical in reducing waiting lists for treatment caused by the pandemic as it has the potential to speed up diagnosis and deliver new and improved ways to treat and support patients. For example, COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of fast and accurate diagnostic testing and genome sequencing to process and share results, and home lateral flow testing showed the potential for increased use of diagnostics outside of formal clinical settings, to support earlier diagnosis and free up staff time.\\n\\nMinister of State for Health Will Quince said:\\n\\nThe UK’s innovative spirit delivered revolutionary technology during the pandemic - from COVID tests and ventilators - and we want to harness this in promoting cutting-edge medical advancements to improve patient care.\\n\\nThe NHS spends around £10 billion a year on medical technology and I’m looking forward to working with industry to use this as we focus on reducing hospital stays, enhancing diagnosis, preventing illness and freeing up staff time.\\n\\nThis new medtech strategy will help build a sustainable NHS with patients at the centre so people can continue to access the right care at the right time.\\n\\nThe key aims of the strategy are to:The implementation plan to deliver on this strategy will be published later this year and will include a review of the £1 billion spent on appliances in primary care, new comparison tools to enable better decision making when purchasing which achieve the best results for patients, and collaboration with industry to ensure availability of key products to keep patients safe.\\n\\nDr Timothy Ferris, National Director for Transformation at NHS England said:\\n\\nMedical technology has an enormous role to play in benefitting patients now and in the future.\\n\\nThe importance of medtech was made clear during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the NHS moves through its recovery, it will play a key role in addressing the challenges we face.\\n\\nDr Sam Roberts of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said:\\n\\nIt is essential that clinicians and patients can access the most impactful and cost-effective medical technologies, while medtech companies need to be confident that they are developing products which meet the needs of patients and the NHS.\\n\\nThis strategy sets out a clear vision for the future. NICE is excited to be part of the delivery of this vision, working with our partners to further develop world leading processes to provide a sustainable pathway for medical technologies, from innovation to implementation.Peter Ellingworth of the Association of British HealthTech Industries said:\\n\\nABHI welcomes the publication of the DHSC medtech strategy, and the recognition it brings to the importance of HealthTech in supporting the NHS to deliver exceptional care for people in the UK. HealthTech plays a valuable role in enabling improved outcomes through changing patient pathways as well as productivity and efficiency gains.\\n\\nIt is important that this strategy supports the ambition of the Life Sciences Vision to create an outstanding business environment for HealthTech companies.

Medical devices, diagnostic tools and digital health solutions offer unparalleled opportunities to improve health outcomes and patient experiences.\\n\\nHowever, the journey from innovation to adoption within the NHS continues to present significant challenges, impacting not only patient care but also the global standing of the UK's HealthTech market.\\n\\nThis matters, as the rapid integration of HealthTech innovations into the NHS has the potential to revolutionise healthcare delivery, offering earlier diagnoses, more precise treatments, and improved care pathways. Yet the current pace of adoption impedes these benefits, delaying the access to cutting-edge solutions that could not only benefit patients, but can deliver operational efficiencies, and fundamentally ensure a more sustainable healthcare system that is better suited to the evolving needs of our population.For UK businesses, these adoption challenges extend beyond the confines of domestic healthcare delivery. The global perception of the UK as a fertile ground for HealthTech innovation is intrinsically linked to how effectively these innovations are embraced by our healthcare system. A streamlined, efficient adoption process not only benefits patients and providers but also enhances the attractiveness of the UK market to international investors and innovators. This further supports patient access to the best technology, and for UK businesses, NHS adoption can lead to success on the international stage. A predictable and innovation-friendly regulatory environment underpins such opportunity, and if we can overcome these hurdles, we can position the UK as a world-leading exemplar in healthcare innovation.\\n\\nAcknowledging the complexities and the imperative of accelerating HealthTech adoption, this report - facilitated by the invaluable insights from stakeholders across the sector and compiled with ABHI’s support - is a call to action. It underscores the need for a concerted effort to refine procurement processes, foster a culture of innovation within the NHS, and establish clear, actionable pathways for integrating new technologies into patient care.\\n\\nI welcome the findings laid out in this analysis by Global Counsel and look forward to collaborating on how these recommendations could be implemented.\\n\\n**Peter Ellingworth**\\n\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVEABHI\\n\\nThe UK medical device and healthcare technologies sector (HealthTech sector) is composed of a diverse range of companies including large multinationals and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The sector is a critical partner in the delivery of healthcare within the NHS, supplying a range of products and services, from syringes and wound dressings to in-vitro diagnostics, surgical robots and the delivery of remote care.\\n\\nHealthTech is a significant contributor to the UK’s economic growth. As the largest employer in the broader Life Sciences sector, HealthTech employs 154,000 people in 4,465 companies, with a combined turnover of £34.3bn. The industry has enjoyed growth of around 5% in recent years. It is characterised by a very large number of small companies, start-ups, and spinouts, supporting the creation of high-quality jobs and sizeable manufacturing and R&D activity across the UK.The potential that the HealthTech sector offers the UK is vast. Newer technologies such as AI, 3D printing and robotics underpin exciting and important developments in prevention, earlier and more accurate diagnosis and precision medicine. More traditional HealthTech continues to enable high-quality, cost-effective care for millions of NHS patients every day. However, adoption and uptake of innovation by the NHS can be slow, resource intensive and inconsistent. The procurement and use of innovative technologies needs to be optimised if we are to realise patient benefits, operational efficiencies, and tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the NHS, such as the elective backlog.\\n\\nImproving the adoption and spread of impactful innovation in the NHS is a well-trodden subject. From the 2011 Innovation of Health and Wealth and 2014 Accelerated Access Review to the ongoing Innovative Ecosystem Programme a decade later, increasing the speed of access and adoption of safe and effective innovation remains a key policy goal. The continued focus on this goal is testament to both the enormous positive impact that its achievement will have on the lives of patients and the operational efficiency of the NHS, but also to the size and complexity of the challenge.With the support of the Association of British HealthTech Industries (ABHI), Global Counsel interviewed stakeholders from across the UK’s HealthTech sector, including large and small companies, healthcare professionals, NHS Trust leaders and procurement managers, senior civil servants and regulators/technology assessors. This paper collates the key challenges and opportunities identified by interviewees and proposes several recommendations to policymakers for how these could be addressed. It builds on previous ABHI publications, including the HealthTech Innovation Adoption Survey and What’s next for the NHS adoption landscape?\\n\\nFor the purpose of this report, we have defined ‘innovation’ in broad terms, as a new technology, device, tool or method that improves patient outcomes, patient experience, and/or makes easier or more productivity the tasks of healthcare professionals. In these terms innovations can represent both small incremental changes and significant step-changes to current pathways/processes – the former often enabling the latter. Respondents shared invaluable insights on what they see as the biggest barriers to adoption of innovation facing the sector, and potential approaches to overcoming them._**Improving the access to, and uptake of, innovative healthcare technologies by the NHS can transform the lives of patients and carers, support a beleaguered healthcare workforce, and improve the productivity and efficiency of the NHS. Getting access and adoption of innovation right will also drive growth in a critical sector of the UK economy.**_**Adoption of innovation in health technology improves patient outcomes.** Developments in diagnostics, medical devices and treatment pathways have increased life expectancy and quality of life for patients suffering from a broad range of disease. In vitro diagnostics alone supports 70% of healthcare decisions across the average patient’s health journey. Even simple tools, like the WHO surgical safety checklist, have been shown to reduce mortality by a third. In addition to improving outcomes, innovation in medical technologies have the potential to improve patient experiences. Cloud-based portals like DrDoctor and AccurRX make it easier and simpler for patients to access services and the development of digital tools, including the NHS app, are designed to enable patients to have greater autonomy over their own care and data. Equally, improving the adoption of HealthTech across the NHS can reduce variations in access to healthcare across the UK. Innovation can be a tool that alleviates health and socioeconomic inequalities and closes the digital divide across the country.**Improving outcomes and easing workloads can help to boost staff retention.** For healthcare providers, balancing provision of the best care for patients whilst safeguarding a beleaguered workforce is a depressing reality. Health tech innovation has the potential to release providers from overly bureaucratic administrative tasks and focus on patient care. Advances in AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have started to show real promise in triaging patients and maximising operational efficiency by rapidly performing repetitive administrative tasks, freeing up staff time to do more patient-facing activities. Moreover, the learning and development opportunities created by new technologies – as clinicians and practitioners develop new technological skills, become innovators themselves, or support research and implementation – not only act as a hook to retain more staff, but also foster a more creative, entrepreneurial, and commercially-minded workforce.**For NHS practitioners, well-implemented innovations can increase productivity.** For instance, part of modernising the NHS means embracing new technologies like AI enabled cancer screening, recently shown to nearly halve radiologist workload whilst detecting a similar number of cancers. In the context of global inflation and a “super-aging” population, requiring more of NHS services, public spending on health continues to rise. But more investment alone is not a panacea. In this context, innovations that can support and simplify, rather than add to, existing workloads and pathways can play a vital role in better utilizing existing capacity, unlocking savings and spending taxpayer money effectively.**HealthTech is a key growth sector for the UK economy.** In 2021/22 core medical technology sites accounted for 44% of sites in the core life sciences sector. The sector also accounted for 18% of the UK’s service and supply sites. In total there were 4,900 medical technology sites across the UK employing approximately 150,000 people. The sector was responsible for £30bn in turnover. Improving UK procurement processes and addressing barriers to adoption and spread within the NHS will be key to supporting scaling innovative companies operating in this sector. Doing so will help to drive economic growth across diverse regions of the UK.\\n\\n_**Several policies, programmes and structures have been established to address the perennial question: “how can we improve the adoption and spread of innovation in the NHS?” Many of these initiatives are relatively new, and time will tell if they can impact the barriers to adoption and spread identified in this report. They are included here as each is designed to directly address many of the barriers to adoption this report identifies and form important context for later discussion on mitigations.**_The views expressed in this report can be attributed to the named author(s) only.\\n\\nWant to learn more about where we can work together?

This is a fantastic opportunity to hear ideas from innovative companies about their ideas to transform the Health Sector.\\n\\nOver the last few weeks we have been working closely with these companies through a series of pitch exercises designed to mirror the challenges when seeking private investment and to better their chances of attracting interest.Despite not being able to deliver these events face-to-face, we still want to provide the companies we have worked with the opportunity to network and connect with the investment community.\\n\\nThank you for joining us to hear from some of the companies on our programmes.\\n\\nThe National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation (i4i) Programme invests in disruptive early-stage medtech technologies to accelerate the translation of innovation into the NHS and the wider market for increased patient benefit. It supports collaborative projects that involve SMEs, universities and the NHS, with strong management teams and a clear commercial pathway towards adoption. The aim is to de-risk technologies to make them attractive to follow-on funders and private investors.\\n\\nNIHR i4i supports innovators across the translational innovation pathway, covering from early stage development to real world testing through three funding streams: • i4i Product Development Awards (PDA) to support any stage of the translational research and development pathway, including the clinical development of laboratory validated technologies or interventions.\\n\\n• i4i Challenge Awards to support the first real world implementation studies of market ready technologies, in order to move innovations a step closer to adoption in the NHS.• i4i Connect aimed at SMEs in need of a funding boost to reach the next stage in the development pathway.\\n\\nThe team manages an investment of $\\\\\\\\pounds199\\\\\\\\mathsf{m}+$ into a portfolio of 279 projects, growing on average by £15m and 25 projects per annum. The portfolio has had two IPOs in the last 2 years, raising a combined value in excess of $\\\\\\\\pounds190\\\\\\\\mathsf{m}$ , and our companies have secured close to $\\\\\\\\pounds700\\\\\\\\mathsf{m}$ of private investment.\\n\\nMore information on the i4i programmes can be found on our website.The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) Healthcare is an NHS England & NHS Improvement initiative, supported by the Academic Health Science Network (AHSN). The aim is to promote UK economic growth whilst addressing unmet health needs and enhancing the take up of known best practice. The initiative supports a programme of competitions inviting companies to come forward with their ideas on novel medtech and digital innovations that can address specific NHS challenges, driving the adoption and increasing the chances of successful implementation. This includes technologies that can improve patients’ health, as well as healthcare service delivery.\\n\\nEarly stage projects are de-risked through a phase gated mechanism, which enables organisations to test feasibility (Phase 1, over 6 months and up to £100K), and if successful to progress forward with product development/clinical testing (Phase 2, over 12 months, up to £1m).\\n\\nThe Programme has recently launched a Phase 3 stage to accelerate innovations in an advanced stage of development into relevant health or social settings, and to facilitate the collection of evidence in real-world settings required by\\n\\ncommissioners and regulators to make purchasing or other\\n\\nrecommendations/decisions.The team manages an investment of $\\\\\\\\pounds100\\\\\\\\mathsf{m}+$ into a portfolio of 229 projects, which have been able to secure additional $\\\\\\\\pounds300\\\\\\\\mathsf{m}+$ through grant funding and venture capital investment. The programme has also a strong commercial focus, with $75+$ products already available to buy, 60 of which are available in the NHS and 23 of which are exported.\\n\\nOur mission is to help UK businesses grow through the development and commercialisation of new products, processes, and services, supported by an outstanding innovation ecosystem that is agile, inclusive, and easy to navigate. Innovate UK uses its knowledge of innovation barriers and business opportunities to support the very best ideas through competition and independent assessment.

Medical devices, diagnostic tools and digital health solutions offer unparalleled opportunities to improve health outcomes and patient experiences.\\n\\nHowever, the journey from innovation to adoption within the NHS continues to present significant challenges, impacting not only patient care but also the global standing of the UK's HealthTech market.\\n\\nThis matters, as the rapid integration of HealthTech innovations into the NHS has the potential to revolutionise healthcare delivery, offering earlier diagnoses, more precise treatments, and improved care pathways. Yet the current pace of adoption impedes these benefits, delaying the access to cutting-edge solutions that could not only benefit patients, but can deliver operational efficiencies, and fundamentally ensure a more sustainable healthcare system that is better suited to the evolving needs of our population.For UK businesses, these adoption challenges extend beyond the confines of domestic healthcare delivery. The global perception of the UK as a fertile ground for HealthTech innovation is intrinsically linked to how effectively these innovations are embraced by our healthcare system. A streamlined, efficient adoption process not only benefits patients and providers but also enhances the attractiveness of the UK market to international investors and innovators. This further supports patient access to the best technology, and for UK businesses, NHS adoption can lead to success on the international stage. A predictable and innovation-friendly regulatory environment underpins such opportunity, and if we can overcome these hurdles, we can position the UK as a world-leading exemplar in healthcare innovation.\\n\\nAcknowledging the complexities and the imperative of accelerating HealthTech adoption, this report - facilitated by the invaluable insights from stakeholders across the sector and compiled with ABHI’s support - is a call to action. It underscores the need for a concerted effort to refine procurement processes, foster a culture of innovation within the NHS, and establish clear, actionable pathways for integrating new technologies into patient care.\\n\\nI welcome the findings laid out in this analysis by Global Counsel and look forward to collaborating on how these recommendations could be implemented.\\n\\n**Peter Ellingworth**\\n\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVEABHI\\n\\nThe UK medical device and healthcare technologies sector (HealthTech sector) is composed of a diverse range of companies including large multinationals and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The sector is a critical partner in the delivery of healthcare within the NHS, supplying a range of products and services, from syringes and wound dressings to in-vitro diagnostics, surgical robots and the delivery of remote care.\\n\\nHealthTech is a significant contributor to the UK’s economic growth. As the largest employer in the broader Life Sciences sector, HealthTech employs 154,000 people in 4,465 companies, with a combined turnover of £34.3bn. The industry has enjoyed growth of around 5% in recent years. It is characterised by a very large number of small companies, start-ups, and spinouts, supporting the creation of high-quality jobs and sizeable manufacturing and R&D activity across the UK.The potential that the HealthTech sector offers the UK is vast. Newer technologies such as AI, 3D printing and robotics underpin exciting and important developments in prevention, earlier and more accurate diagnosis and precision medicine. More traditional HealthTech continues to enable high-quality, cost-effective care for millions of NHS patients every day. However, adoption and uptake of innovation by the NHS can be slow, resource intensive and inconsistent. The procurement and use of innovative technologies needs to be optimised if we are to realise patient benefits, operational efficiencies, and tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the NHS, such as the elective backlog.\\n\\nImproving the adoption and spread of impactful innovation in the NHS is a well-trodden subject. From the 2011 Innovation of Health and Wealth and 2014 Accelerated Access Review to the ongoing Innovative Ecosystem Programme a decade later, increasing the speed of access and adoption of safe and effective innovation remains a key policy goal. The continued focus on this goal is testament to both the enormous positive impact that its achievement will have on the lives of patients and the operational efficiency of the NHS, but also to the size and complexity of the challenge.With the support of the Association of British HealthTech Industries (ABHI), Global Counsel interviewed stakeholders from across the UK’s HealthTech sector, including large and small companies, healthcare professionals, NHS Trust leaders and procurement managers, senior civil servants and regulators/technology assessors. This paper collates the key challenges and opportunities identified by interviewees and proposes several recommendations to policymakers for how these could be addressed. It builds on previous ABHI publications, including the HealthTech Innovation Adoption Survey and What’s next for the NHS adoption landscape?\\n\\nFor the purpose of this report, we have defined ‘innovation’ in broad terms, as a new technology, device, tool or method that improves patient outcomes, patient experience, and/or makes easier or more productivity the tasks of healthcare professionals. In these terms innovations can represent both small incremental changes and significant step-changes to current pathways/processes – the former often enabling the latter. Respondents shared invaluable insights on what they see as the biggest barriers to adoption of innovation facing the sector, and potential approaches to overcoming them._**Improving the access to, and uptake of, innovative healthcare technologies by the NHS can transform the lives of patients and carers, support a beleaguered healthcare workforce, and improve the productivity and efficiency of the NHS. Getting access and adoption of innovation right will also drive growth in a critical sector of the UK economy.**_**Adoption of innovation in health technology improves patient outcomes.** Developments in diagnostics, medical devices and treatment pathways have increased life expectancy and quality of life for patients suffering from a broad range of disease. In vitro diagnostics alone supports 70% of healthcare decisions across the average patient’s health journey. Even simple tools, like the WHO surgical safety checklist, have been shown to reduce mortality by a third. In addition to improving outcomes, innovation in medical technologies have the potential to improve patient experiences. Cloud-based portals like DrDoctor and AccurRX make it easier and simpler for patients to access services and the development of digital tools, including the NHS app, are designed to enable patients to have greater autonomy over their own care and data. Equally, improving the adoption of HealthTech across the NHS can reduce variations in access to healthcare across the UK. Innovation can be a tool that alleviates health and socioeconomic inequalities and closes the digital divide across the country.**Improving outcomes and easing workloads can help to boost staff retention.** For healthcare providers, balancing provision of the best care for patients whilst safeguarding a beleaguered workforce is a depressing reality. Health tech innovation has the potential to release providers from overly bureaucratic administrative tasks and focus on patient care. Advances in AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have started to show real promise in triaging patients and maximising operational efficiency by rapidly performing repetitive administrative tasks, freeing up staff time to do more patient-facing activities. Moreover, the learning and development opportunities created by new technologies – as clinicians and practitioners develop new technological skills, become innovators themselves, or support research and implementation – not only act as a hook to retain more staff, but also foster a more creative, entrepreneurial, and commercially-minded workforce.**For NHS practitioners, well-implemented innovations can increase productivity.** For instance, part of modernising the NHS means embracing new technologies like AI enabled cancer screening, recently shown to nearly halve radiologist workload whilst detecting a similar number of cancers. In the context of global inflation and a “super-aging” population, requiring more of NHS services, public spending on health continues to rise. But more investment alone is not a panacea. In this context, innovations that can support and simplify, rather than add to, existing workloads and pathways can play a vital role in better utilizing existing capacity, unlocking savings and spending taxpayer money effectively.**HealthTech is a key growth sector for the UK economy.** In 2021/22 core medical technology sites accounted for 44% of sites in the core life sciences sector. The sector also accounted for 18% of the UK’s service and supply sites. In total there were 4,900 medical technology sites across the UK employing approximately 150,000 people. The sector was responsible for £30bn in turnover. Improving UK procurement processes and addressing barriers to adoption and spread within the NHS will be key to supporting scaling innovative companies operating in this sector. Doing so will help to drive economic growth across diverse regions of the UK.\\n\\n_**Several policies, programmes and structures have been established to address the perennial question: “how can we improve the adoption and spread of innovation in the NHS?” Many of these initiatives are relatively new, and time will tell if they can impact the barriers to adoption and spread identified in this report. They are included here as each is designed to directly address many of the barriers to adoption this report identifies and form important context for later discussion on mitigations.**_\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-strategy-to-boost-nhs-access-to-innovative-medical-technology\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS medical technology strategy implementation plan, diversification across funding schemes\",\n    \"content\": \"We use some essential cookies to make this website work.\\n\\nWe’d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your settings and improve government services.\\n\\nWe also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.\\n\\nYou have accepted additional cookies.

As a result, patients will continue to have access to high-quality care, alongside improved patient safety and health outcomes.\\n\\nThe strategy aims to deliver value for money, using the latest data on the effectiveness of new technology to ensure prices are reasonable for the health system. It will also help build resilient supply chains and ensure the UK is prepared for future pandemics, just as demand for technology like syringes and ventilators rapidly increase during the pandemic.Using medtech effectively will be critical in reducing waiting lists for treatment caused by the pandemic as it has the potential to speed up diagnosis and deliver new and improved ways to treat and support patients. For example, COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of fast and accurate diagnostic testing and genome sequencing to process and share results, and home lateral flow testing showed the potential for increased use of diagnostics outside of formal clinical settings, to support earlier diagnosis and free up staff time.\\n\\nMinister of State for Health Will Quince said:\\n\\nThe UK’s innovative spirit delivered revolutionary technology during the pandemic - from COVID tests and ventilators - and we want to harness this in promoting cutting-edge medical advancements to improve patient care.\\n\\nThe NHS spends around £10 billion a year on medical technology and I’m looking forward to working with industry to use this as we focus on reducing hospital stays, enhancing diagnosis, preventing illness and freeing up staff time.\\n\\nThis new medtech strategy will help build a sustainable NHS with patients at the centre so people can continue to access the right care at the right time.\\n\\nThe key aims of the strategy are to:The implementation plan to deliver on this strategy will be published later this year and will include a review of the £1 billion spent on appliances in primary care, new comparison tools to enable better decision making when purchasing which achieve the best results for patients, and collaboration with industry to ensure availability of key products to keep patients safe.\\n\\nDr Timothy Ferris, National Director for Transformation at NHS England said:\\n\\nMedical technology has an enormous role to play in benefitting patients now and in the future.\\n\\nThe importance of medtech was made clear during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the NHS moves through its recovery, it will play a key role in addressing the challenges we face.\\n\\nDr Sam Roberts of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said:\\n\\nIt is essential that clinicians and patients can access the most impactful and cost-effective medical technologies, while medtech companies need to be confident that they are developing products which meet the needs of patients and the NHS.\\n\\nThis strategy sets out a clear vision for the future. NICE is excited to be part of the delivery of this vision, working with our partners to further develop world leading processes to provide a sustainable pathway for medical technologies, from innovation to implementation.Peter Ellingworth of the Association of British HealthTech Industries said:\\n\\nABHI welcomes the publication of the DHSC medtech strategy, and the recognition it brings to the importance of HealthTech in supporting the NHS to deliver exceptional care for people in the UK. HealthTech plays a valuable role in enabling improved outcomes through changing patient pathways as well as productivity and efficiency gains.\\n\\nIt is important that this strategy supports the ambition of the Life Sciences Vision to create an outstanding business environment for HealthTech companies. We look forward to working closely with the Directorate in the implementation the strategy.\\n\\nThis strategy follows action to cut NHS waiting times as one of the government’s top 5 priorities, backed by up to £14.1 billion of health and social care funding available for the next 2 years, on top of record funding and the publishing of a new urgent and emergency care recovery plan.\\n\\nThe following links open in a new tab\\n\\n\\nDon’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.\\n\\nTo help us improve GOV.UK, we’d like to know more about your visit today.\\nPlease fill in this survey (opens in a new tab).# New strategy to boost NHS access to innovative medical technology## Cookies on GOV.UK\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The previous browsing actions provided useful context on NHS funding schemes (SBRI Healthcare, NIHR i4i) and their role in attracting private investment, plus NHS's overall medtech strategy.

This milestone fund is designed to back HealthTech superscalers with strong potential to grow both within the UK’s NHS and across the US healthcare market.\\n\\nFounded in 2021, Meridian Health Ventures is the first NHS-anchored VC fund with a dual-Atlantic strategy, investing in clinically grounded technologies with global applications. The firm is led by General Partners Daniel Dickens, Dr. Nadine Hachach-Haram, Tim Irish and Dr. Pooja Sikka – a team combining experience as clinicians, investors, entrepreneurs, and operators. Their shared mission: support scalable innovations without losing UK-grown talent and impact to overseas markets.“With this Fund, we want to supercharge the growth of the most promising innovations so they can deliver direct benefits to the NHS’s patients and workforce, as well as the wider UK economy,” said Dr. Nadine Hachach-Haram, in a statement. “Through transatlantic collaboration, we are also creating an environment where ambitious founders can scale at pace – both domestically and internationally – bridging the gap between UK NHS and US healthcare systems for a start.”\\n\\nMeridian’s portfolio already includes some of the UK’s fastest-growing HealthTech companies such as Doccla, deepc, Patchwork, Tympa Health, Apian, iFAST Diagnostics, PocDoc, Phare Health, 52 North, and MediShout. These companies have collectively deployed solutions in over 100 NHS Trusts and are increasingly expanding their footprint to major US healthcare providers, including Cedars-Sinai.\\n\\nTwelve NHS Clinical Entrepreneurs are among the founding teams in the fund’s portfolio, further anchoring innovation in the realities of frontline care. The firm has also tapped into talent emerging from top UK institutions like Oxford, Cambridge, King’s College, Imperial, and Southampton.Daniel Dickens, Co-Managing Partner at Meridian Health Ventures, emphasised the importance of scaling innovations within the UK: “As Founders ourselves, we’ve launched this Fund to ensure that the next generation of HealthTech breakthroughs can be scaled in the UK, not just invented here. We’re proud to partner with this group of leading health systems and healthcare investors on both sides of the Atlantic, and of course to work with the driven and talented founding teams in the Fund’s portfolio.”\\n\\nThe fund is anchored by prominent institutions including Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College Hospital, University College London Hospitals, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Hartford HealthCare is also expected to join soon, signalling further transatlantic momentum.\\n\\n_**Also Read**: MedTech World Partners with MedTech Innovator for Exclusive Startup-Investor Event in Bay Area, California_This fund isn’t the firm’s only step into thematic investing. In October 2024, it launched Europe’s first dedicated mental health tech fund, the Innovations in Mental Health (IMH) Fund, backed by the Wellcome Trust and in partnership with South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Together with the new transatlantic fund, these initiatives represent a €44.7 million commitment to transformative care.\\n\\nFor Cedars-Sinai, a long-time collaborator with the Meridian team, the alignment is strategic. James D. Laur, JD, Chief Intellectual Property Officer at Cedars-Sinai and Managing Director of Cedars-Sinai Health Ventures, said: “Our mission is to provide patients around the world with the best care possible. We have been impressed by the quality and depth of the HealthTech Founders in their portfolio and are excited to build on our collaboration as Partners in the Fund.”\\n\\nBy enabling ambitious HealthTech startups to scale both within the UK and internationally, Meridian Health Ventures is addressing a key challenge: ensuring homegrown solutions can grow without leaving the ecosystem that birthed them.The new transatlantic fund isn’t just about capital – it’s about capability, credibility and collaboration. In doing so, it may help reframe the trajectory for the UK’s most promising clinical innovators.\\n\\nMedTech World Bay Area will take place on June 26–27, 2025, in collaboration with MedTech Innovator. The event offers a focused setting for sponsors and investors to connect directly with 100 fundraising startups and key stakeholders in medical technology. Across the two days, attendees can expect practical discussions and targeted networking, including panels such as ‘What Investors Want in 2025: New Rules of MedTech Fundraising’ and ‘Regulatory to Revenue: Building with the End in Mind’.

Is it more resilient today?\\n\\nIn this webinar, Dominic Lion is joined by Sam Hiller, Partner – Construction, Gallagher Specialty and Andy Kane, Head of Construction & Enginee...\\n\\nThe U.S. is a world outlier when it comes to healthcare spending.With around $14,423 spent per capita in 2023, the USA spends more on healthcare than any country in the world. The UK by comparison spends only £3,085 per capita. But as the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) experiences the ‘ worst crisis in its 75-year history’ and the USA has the lowest life expectancy among high-income countries as well as the highest rates of avoidable deaths, how well is that investment being used?\\n\\nTechnology in most industries is implemented to drive efficiencies and create savings long term, however for many businesses the initial investment can be a hard pill to swallow, and healthcare is no different. Budgets are already stretched and with a bumper election year in 2024, governments in both the USA and the UK will be hedging their bets on spending priorities. Whilst policy continuity will mostly prevail there will be delays to initiatives and short-term shifts in spending. Similarly in emerging markets, increased debt rollover challenges will result in strained government health budgets.In the UK, it’s difficult to say where the technology investment trends are as the publicly funded NHS operates across 215 ‘trusts’ that don’t share the same infrastructure; the focus here is often on back-office solutions for administration rather than on health outcomes.\\n\\nThanks to the funding models, health technology investment in the USA is much clearer. According to a 2023 survey from Deloitte Insights, investors have shifted away from telemedicine and towards “hands-on care delivery approaches and value-based care solutions”. Similarly to the UK, back-office solutions that show quick return on investment are still appealing, but there are now a wave of start-ups tackling these investment opportunities with a platform-enabled ecosystem approach which will ultimately improve patient experiences.Of course, healthcare spending can’t be discussed without acknowledgement of COVID-19. The pandemic had a significant impact on global healthcare infrastructure, pushing it to its limits. However even before the pandemic, days off work from sickness cost £18bn in the UK and $225bn in the USA. In addition to stress and musculoskeletal issues, the most common causes for being off sick from work are minor illnesses like cold, flu and other respiratory infections. Respiratory issues are on the rise in both countries with both the CDC and ONS citing decreased immunity as a concern alongside increased exposure to pollutants.\\n\\nThe federal government spent approximately $5 trillion on relief measures. The CARES Act alone accounted for about $2.2 trillion in economic relief.Whilst ultimately the reduction of fossil fuel use, our encroachment on natural habitats, and the reversal of climate change, are the keys to cleaning up our air, installation of systems like PRS in public buildings and offices could go a long way in improving health and safety, and legislating to include these systems would have a huge impact.\\n\\nWhilst the London Market doesn’t tend to include warranties in policy language, underwriters could begin to stipulate the PRS system’s usage as a basis for favourable terms and pricing due to the asset being a ‘better risk’, similar to having telematics in a car to monitor driving with it ensuing favourable impact on accidents and claims reductions.\\n\\nBut the insurance industry can support in more ways than simply incentivising through premiums. Risk assessments and risk engineering are a core function of London Market brokers, generating vast amounts of data on building performance globally. This data, along with claims trends, could be shared with policymakers to help create more effective building regulations that can reduce risk and losses.\\n\\nBy endorsing and supporting buildings that meet higher environmental and safety standards, insurers can influence the market and encourage legislative changes.Investing in healthcare is more than just allocating funds - it's about ensuring those investments lead to meaningful improvements in public health outcomes, safety, and long-term environmental sustainability. Whether it’s the USA’s high expenditure or the UK’s struggle with an overstretched system, the key takeaway is clear: smart investment in technology and infrastructure is essential. Solutions like PRS illustrate how targeted investments can significantly enhance human health outcomes while also addressing broader issues like energy conservation, environmental sustainability and air quality. As we look to the future, it’s vital that both governments and industries, including insurance, prioritise and support these innovative solutions. Only by aligning financial investment with forward-thinking strategies and proven innovation can we truly elevate global healthcare standards and build a healthier, more resilient society.\\n\\nThe Walbrook Building\\n25 Walbrook\\nLondon, EC4N 8AW\\n\\nLegal & Regulatory \\\\| Privacy PolicyGallagher Specialty is highlighting Pathogen Reduction Solutions in this article based on its relevance and potential benefits to our clients.

The goal is to align MediCare Innovation's investment strategy with the NHS's priorities for adopting innovative medical technologies, ultimately aiming for both financial returns and positive health outcomes within the UK healthcare system.\n\n### Strategic Roadmap and Phased Approach\n\nThe strategic roadmap for MediCare Innovation's investments in NHS UK funding schemes will be implemented through a phased approach, allowing for systematic exploration, investment, and scaling of promising health technologies. This phased strategy is designed to mitigate risk, build expertise, and maximize the potential for successful adoption within the NHS.\n\n**Phase 1: Foundation and Exploration (Years 1-2)**\n\n*   **Focus:** Building a foundational understanding of the NHS innovation landscape and identifying initial investment opportunities.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   In-depth analysis of key NHS funding schemes, including SBRI Healthcare, NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA), and the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM).\n    *   Establishing relationships with relevant NHS bodies, Health Innovation Networks, and other key stakeholders.\n    *   Identifying early-stage innovations aligned with NHS priorities and demonstrating initial evidence of impact.\n    *   Initial investments in a limited number of promising projects through schemes like SBRI Healthcare (Phase 1 and 2) and potentially early engagement with NIA candidates.\n*   **Milestones:**\n    *   Completion of a comprehensive landscape analysis of NHS funding schemes.\n    *   Establishment of initial contacts within the NHS innovation ecosystem.\n    *   Execution of 3-5 early-stage investments.\n*   **Investment Decision Points:** Evaluation of initial project performance and alignment with strategic goals before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n**Phase 2: Portfolio Development and Scaling (Years 3-5)**\n\n*   **Focus:** Expanding the investment portfolio and actively supporting the scaling of successful innovations within the NHS.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   Increased investment in projects demonstrating positive results from Phase 1, potentially through SBRI Healthcare Phase 3 or follow-on funding rounds.\n    *   Targeted investments in innovations aligned with the MTFM criteria, focusing on NICE-approved, cost-saving technologies.\n    *   Leveraging the NIA network to support the spread and adoption of portfolio companies.\n    *   Exploring opportunities within other identified NHS programs and initiatives.\n    *   Developing strategies for navigating NHS procurement processes and demonstrating value for money.\n*   **Milestones:**\n    *   Growth of the investment portfolio to 10-15 projects.\n    *   Successful adoption of at least 2-3 portfolio innovations within multiple NHS trusts or regions.\n    *   Establishment of a clear pathway for portfolio companies to engage with the MTFM.\n*   **Investment Decision Points:** Assessment of portfolio performance, market traction within the NHS, and potential for wider adoption before entering Phase 3.\n\n**Phase 3: Long-Term Impact and Diversification (Years 6+)**\n\n*   **Focus:** Sustaining long-term impact within the NHS and diversifying investments across a broader range of healthcare innovation areas.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   Continued investment in scaling innovations and exploring opportunities for wider national adoption.\n    *   Diversification of the portfolio to include innovations addressing a wider range of clinical needs and NHS priorities, potentially including digital health transformation and AI-enabled technologies.\n    *   Exploring potential for transatlantic collaboration and scaling of UK innovations into the US market, potentially leveraging initiatives like the Meridian Health Ventures fund.\n    *   Contributing to shaping the future of NHS innovation policy through insights gained from the investment portfolio.\n*   **Milestones:**\n    *   Significant impact of portfolio innovations on patient outcomes and NHS efficiency.\n    *   A well-diversified portfolio across various health technology areas.\n    *   Recognition as a key partner in driving innovation within the NHS.\n*   **Investment Decision Points:** Ongoing evaluation of market trends, NHS needs, and portfolio performance to inform future investment decisions.\n\n### Diversification Strategies Across NHS Funding Schemes\n\nDiversification is crucial to mitigate risk and capitalize on the varied opportunities within the NHS innovation ecosystem. MediCare Innovation will diversify its investments across the following key schemes:\n\n*   **SBRI Healthcare:** This program provides phased funding for the development of innovative solutions to specific NHS challenges. Investments here will focus on early-stage feasibility and development, de-risking technologies for follow-on investment.\n*   **NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA):** The NIA supports the scaling of high-impact innovations across the NHS. Investing in companies accepted into the NIA provides access to a network and support system designed to accelerate adoption.\n*   **MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM):** This policy mandates funding for selected NICE-approved, cost-saving medical technologies.
