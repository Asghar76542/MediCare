We translated this conceptualisation as follows: attaining a return-on-investment whatever that is, is valued and therefore of benefit, and any benefit is of value in and of itself.

From research to reality: research and innovation in the NHS as key to enabling the 10-Year Plan – Extended Summary. Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation. RR-A3808-1.Embedding research and innovation throughout the NHS is the ‘fourth shift’ that will underpin the 10-Year Plan. NHS-wide research and innovation is the platform that will catalyse servicewide improvements in care quality, patient outcomes and experience, productivity and the sustainability of the NHS. Healthcare is a knowledge-intensive sector, and if research and innovation are not actively supported and enabled, the gap between what is possible to achieve and what materialises in practice will grow. The government’s focus on developing a ten-year plan for health and care aims to respond to serious challenges to NHS sustainability and performance. The government is emphasising three big shifts: (1) from hospital to community, (2) from sickness to prevention, and (3) from analogue to digital. These three shifts depend on the capacity to learn, innovate and embed change throughout the NHS. This fourth shift, from seeing research and innovation as a ‘nice to have’ to seeing it as essential, is central to efforts to transform the NHS and make it fit for the present and the future. We call this shift: from research to reality.Lord Darzi’s independent investigation of the NHS in England indicates that research and innovation have a key role to play in enabling a more sustainable NHS. Research and innovation should not be seen as second-order priorities. The UK has a strong base in health research,\\n\\nranging from basic and applied biomedical research and clinical trials to evidence on how best to reorganise and reform the delivery of health services. From a health policy perspective, research and innovation should provide the evidence, insights and skills to support change and improvement throughout the NHS. However, this potential has not yet been realised.\\n\\nResearch and innovation in the NHS remains fragmented, beset by systemic inefficiencies, with insufficient opportunity and incentive for NHS staff to engage, and weak links between NHS policy priorities and wider industrial strategy. Overcoming these challenges and embedding research and innovation throughout the NHS will be pivotal to achieving the aims of the 10-Year Health Plan and bringing wider societal and economic benefits.This summary report highlights key insights from a study commissioned by Wellcome and delivered by RAND Europe to help inform a vision for research and innovation in the health system, with a particular emphasis on the NHS. This work was part of a wider collaborative project between Wellcome, RAND Europe and Nesta. RAND Europe’s work focused on:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn analysis of evidence on the impacts of health research and innovation in and around the NHS.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase studies in five key areas of strategic importance to the NHS: genomics, artificial intelligence, digital innovation in mental health, participatory research and tech-enabled remote monitoring (please see the Appendix at the end of this document, p.19).\\n\\n\\n\\nAn analysis of the ecosystem of support mechanisms needed to enable a research-and-innovation-powered NHS that can deliver benefits for patients and the public, the NHS and wider health system, the economy and society.The study began in November 2024 and was informed by desk research, literature review, case studies and stakeholder engagement through interviews and a workshop. The study has also benefited from a long-standing body of work on research, innovation and health systems transformation by the RAND Europe research team. The full report detailing the evidence and learning will be available in early March 2025, alongside all references that support the analysis and inferences made.\\n\\nBox 1 summarises the diversity of benefits from a research-and-innovation-powered health system in and around the NHS. Figures 2-5 in the appendix to this report illustrate current impacts and future potential through examples in five case study areas.\\n\\nResearch and innovation in and around the NHS lead to a wide range of benefits. These span:\\n\\n\\n\\nImproving care quality, safety and productivity: Participating in research and clinical trials is linked to better NHS adherence to evidence-based practice, improved treatment protocols and high-quality care, as well as greater openness to innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnabling job satisfaction and workforce retention: Research activity can make NHS organisations more attractive as employers and contribute to job satisfaction.Improving patient health outcomes and experience: Research and innovation give patients early access to novel, potentially lifesaving treatments. Research activity is linked to reduced mortality rates and increased patient confidence in healthcare professionals\\n\\nContributing to health systems resilience: Research was key to the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and surveillance research, pathogen genome sequencing, data modelling and vaccine innovation all have key roles to play in pandemic preparedness. Research also informs adaptations in health service delivery that support resilience.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting economic benefits: Health research and innovation not only help saves lives, but also creates jobs and revenue and contributes to productivity. New treatments also improve people’s quality of life, enabling them to remain employed and reducing absenteeism.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnabling wider societal benefits and the UK’s reputation as a global research leader: The UK is recognised as a clinical research leader, which helps attract international collaborators, increases research reach and impact and creates spillover benefits (e.g. patents).Commercially sponsored clinical trials are a visible example of where collaborative action to address current obstacles would bring both health and economic benefits. However, the potential of research and innovation to support NHS transformation extends beyond trials alone and is key to delivering the three shifts identified by the government. Research and innovation capacity and skills for learning and improvement throughout the NHS are critical to seeing those shifts happen in practice. To illustrate:\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding health and disease: Basic research can help us understand the mechanisms underpinning health and disease, which is a prerequisite for efforts to identify successful prevention and treatment approaches.\\n\\n\\n\\nApplied research informs new prevention, diagnosis and more personalised treatment approaches. Such research also feeds into the development of innovations (often in collaboration between the NHS, academia and industry), including technologies that can facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions and digital health innovations to facilitate care in the community and help reduce waiting lists and backlogs.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmbedding evidence-based best practice in the NHS: Health services research and evaluation provide actionable insights into how innovations can be implemented and services improved in practice, across neighbourhoods and communities in the UK.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/aac/what-we-do/how-can-the-aac-help-me/the-medtech-funding-mandate/\",\n    \"query\": \"regulatory requirements and compliance NHS healthcare technology adoption\",\n    \"content\": \"We’ve put some small files called cookies on your device to make our site work.\\n\\nWe’d also like to use analytics cookies.

The MTFM aims to ensure patients and the NHS benefit from clinically effective and cost saving medical technologies faster and more equitably.Technologies covered by the MTFM are typically funded by commissioners from their existing allocations. This is deliverable as the technologies supported are National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended and meet the criteria to save costs and resources and make a return on investment within three years.\\n\\nNHS England and NICE jointly consulted on building an integrated, rules-based medical technologies (medtech) pathway in July 2024. Together with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NICE, we will update the policies and processes and develop an improved pathway for MedTech. For 2025/26 the MedTech Funding Mandate policy will not be supporting any additional technologies while the Rules Based Pathway for MedTech is being developed.\\n\\nRead the latest guidance here: NHS England » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate policy – guidance for NHS commissioners and providers of NHS-funded care\\n\\n2021/22 marked the first year of the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy, where four technologies were supported. Patients are, on average, now accessing these technologies in over three quarters of eligible providers.During 2021/22, the monthly number of patients accessing Heartflow increased by 35% and over the year, the innovation created over £2.2 million worth of savings for the NHS, bringing the total savings it has generated while under MTFM support to £5 million.\\n\\nGammacore and placental growth factor-based testing both saw their usage rise in 2021/22, with a further 19 trusts adopting Gammacore and eight more offering patients PLGF, despite the removal of national, ring-fenced funding. Gammacore is now offered to patients by 95% of eligible providers.\\n\\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the number of patients accessing SecurAcath rose by 518%, from 1500 to 9270 per month. In 2021/22, the innovation achieved estimated savings of £2.5million.\\n\\nThe MTFM has continued to ensure patients get quicker access to innovative technologies in 2022/23, with 141,895 patients benefitting from use of MTFM supported technologies.**Retired teacher Sue Field, who has been using Apos for a number of years describes how she has benefitted from access to Apos**:\\n\\n“I decided to try Apos treatment because at the age of 55, really wasn’t keen to have knee surgery at that time. Very quickly, even at the first appointment, I found that I was walking without as much pain and without limping and found that my symptoms eased dramatically. I can now walk for many miles without pain in my knees. I’m able to sleep at night and the benefits to my mental health and well-being have been immense.”\\n\\nTo be supported by the MTFM, technologies must meet the policy’s three criteria and align with broader NHS England programmes (for example, Net Zero). These criteria require that technologies:\\n\\nNHS England together with the Heath Innovation Network and NHS Supply Chain continuously assess published NICE guidance to understand which technologies meet this criteria.\\n\\nThe latest technology selected for support in 2024/25 is AposHealth.\\n\\nNHS providers and commissioners are encouraged to review NICE MTG76 and contact NHS Supply Chain to understand the benefits of adopting AposHealth, as well as other MTFM supported technologies.The MTFM will continue supporting the four technologies selected in 2021/22 and the seven selected for support in 2022/23.\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2022/23 were:\\n\\nThe technologies selected for support in 2021/22 were:\\n\\nProposals in a joint NHS England and NICE consultation published in May 2024 set out how establishing a new look MedTech pathway will make it easier still for the most promising clinically and cost-effective technologies to be procured and adopted within the NHS.\\n\\nThe MTFM policy remains in place for 2024/25 and will be reviewed alongside the MedTech pathway consultation. NHS England will continue to assess guidance published by NICE whilst the new pathway is developed.\\n\\nOur FutureNHS collaboration platform contains more information and helpful resources on the MedTech Funding Mandate Policy.\\n\\nPlease email [england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net](mailto:england.medtechfundingmandate@nhs.net) for any queries and to request access to our FutureNHS platform.Providers wishing to implement MTFM supported technologies should contact their local HIN.\\n\\nInformation on how to procure MTFM supported technologies can be found on NHS Supply Chain’s MedTech Funding Mandate page.\\n\\nVideos available on the HIN YouTube channel, provide an overview of the policy and the financial flow between NHS England, healthcare providers and commissioners.\\n\\nThe Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool was created for health technology innovators and developers in England to help them navigate the different stages involved in getting a new technology adopted into the NHS.\\n\\nThe tool explains the innovation journey through a five-stage process, highlighting the key steps and activities involved at each stage, so that innovators can understand the end-to-end pathway from creation through to product commissioning and monitoring.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England have invested £30 million to support the adoption and acceleration of technologies which can improve patient care in 2024-25. The Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund (HTAAF) was taken up by 41 Integrated Care Systems across the country. The funds will be used to propel innovative medical technology into patients’ care pathways across various areas including: increasing remote and self-monitoring, at home management, speeding up cancer diagnostics and increasing elective capacity as well as clinical productivity. DHSC and NHS England will continue to work with frontline services over the coming year to understand the impact which these funds have had on patients.# Cookies on the NHS England website# Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support## Impact to date## How the policy works## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2024/25## Technologies supported by the MedTech Funding Mandate in 2021/22 and 2022/23## Medical technology (MedTech) pathway consultation## Additional information## Introducing the Health Technology Navigation Pathway Tool## Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund\\n\\nNHS Accelerated Access Collaborative » Medical technology (MedTech) funding mandate and support\\n----------------\\nEnd of this webpage.

A fit for purpose estate means that we can deliver the kind of modern, digitally enabled patient care pathways that we know result in significant improvements for patients, staff and anyone involved with the NHS.If the NHS is to deliver its own plan for change, it must invest in the infrastructure and buildings it needs to underpin clinical service provision and demonstrate to government how and where capital investment is required.\\n\\nThe need is therefore clear for each integrated care system (ICS) to have a clear and well planned strategy for is infrastructure.\\n\\nThis practical guidance, based on learning from pilots and best practice across government, supports ICSs to develop a 10-year strategy. More detailed information, templates and best practice examples are available on the NHS Estates Collaboration Hub.\\n\\nIn developing their infrastructure strategy ICSs need to focus on, but not be limited to, having a clear understanding of the following:\\n\\nNHS England is working to produce a nationally agreed set of infrastructure priorities, informed and shaped by local needs and requirements.This builds on work instigated by the Government’s response (2018) to Sir Robert Naylor’s independent review of NHS property and estates (2017). This response accepted recommendations that local systems should develop affordable estates and infrastructure plans (recommendation 9), and that local systems that fail to develop sufficiently stretching plans should not be granted access to capital funding (recommendation 10). In 2018/19 NHS England mandated the completion of sustainability and transformation partnership (STPs) estate strategies to inform ‘STP Wave 4 and Wave 4b’ capital funding. Those strategies included a prioritised capital pipeline, which now needs to be reviewed and updated.\\n\\nIn 2022, Dr Claire Fuller’s stocktake report Next steps for integrating primary care highlighted the need for a detailed review of the space available in each system, service by service, to inform future ICS-level infrastructure planning. It also identified the need for a significant increase in the number of healthcare practitioners locally and therefore space and increased capacity for them to deliver healthcare is more than likely to be needed. In response to the report, all 42 ICS chief executives committed to take forward the actions.While the main focus of these strategies is the physical resource we have at our disposal, ICSs must consider their estates workforce. The NHS People Plan 2020/21: Action for us all and NHS Estates and Facilities Workforce Action Plan focus on how we need more people, working differently, in a compassionate and inclusive culture to deliver patient care. Including an estate workforce plan within the ICS infrastructure strategy will identify how the ICS will contribute to these national objectives and ensure it has the capacity and capability in place to deliver complex ICS infrastructure requirements and ambitions.\\n\\nLastly, the Delivering a ‘Net Zero’ National Health Service report became statutory guidance following the assent of the Health and Social Care Act in July 2022. This commits the NHS to be net zero in core emissions by 2040, with an 80% reduction by 2032. Energy emissions from buildings and other aspects of estates work make up the largest share of core NHS emissions. Estates teams will need to develop trust-level and ICS strategies that integrate their heat decarbonisation plans for transition from fossil-fuel heating systems to net zero systems. The infrastructure strategy will help ensure plans are developed in line with future development.ICSs need to implement appropriate building blocks for strategic estates planning, to allow them to plan effectively for the long term, demonstrate value for money, and ensure risk is managed and any major developments are evidence-based and overseen effectively. They should:\\n\\nBelow we outline the content for the main sections in all infrastructure strategies, but these sections are not an exhaustive list.\\n\\nThe shape and structure of ICS infrastructure strategies may vary by organisation, depending on local context, ICS maturity and local priorities. We request, however, that strategies follow the templates and toolkits provided on the NHS Estates Collaboration Hub to ensure consistency across the system.\\n\\nBelow we outline the content for the main sections in all infrastructure strategies, but these sections are not an exhaustive list.\\n\\nThis should summarise the main points from each section of the strategy and provide a high level ‘system roadmap’ that looks back at achievements over the past few years and 10 years into the future.\\n\\nThis should provide the ICS context, including the number of employees, services provided, size, geography and population demographics, and any other background information that informs infrastructure planning.This section should also outline the system partners, their joint priorities and how the ICS works, and provide details of the ICS’s governance relating to estates (including for the estates team, senior responsible officer (SRO) and reporting mechanisms).\\n\\nThere should also be details of how the strategy will be monitored, including appropriate success metrics, and how often it will be reviewed and/or updated. We recommend this is at least every 2 years, but it will depend on local and national circumstances. .\\n\\nThis section should outline existing ICS priorities, transformation programmes and structure, and the importance of estates and infrastructure as an enabler for delivery.\\n\\nIt should set out how the ICS’s priorities and the strategy will align to national drivers such as:\\n\\nSee the appendix for detail on the programmes that should be referenced.\\n\\nIt should set out the future clinical model for the ICS and details of how infrastructure will support this and the required level of investment and resource.\\n\\nThis section should describe the estate and infrastructure progress over the past 5 years; for example, new developments, estates efficiencies.It should outline the opportunities and challenges with the existing estate and infrastructure across the system, including age, backlog maintenance, critical infrastructure risk, non-clinical space, utilisation, possible disposals and investment to date.\\n\\nThis information should be supported by data analysis and show how data is used for effective decision-making and prioritisation.\\n\\nThis section should set out the ICS’s vision for its estate and infrastructure, including the key estates and infrastructure priorities for the next 10 years, and how this prioritisation will realise the overall vision.\\n\\nIt should list the specific objectives. These should be SMART and have a specific deadline or timeline.\\n\\nThe section should describe:\\n\\nThis section builds on the objectives in the previous section, setting out detail on the required workstreams, deliverables and action to achieve them over the next decade.\\n\\nFor each workstream, this detail should include:\\n\\nAdditional resources are available for NHS estates teams on the NHS Estates Collaboration Hub, including templates, data packs, case studies and examples of best practice.\\n\\nThe national NHS England Estates Strategy and Planning team will run regular webinars over the coming months to support strategy development; details can be found on the hub.Please direct any enquiries to national NHS England Estates Strategy and Planning team at [England.estatesandfacilities@nhs.net](mailto:England.estatesandfacilities@nhs.net)\\n\\nThe NHS Estates and Facilities Workforce Action Plan (WAP) sets out how we will fulfil the ambitions of the NHS People Plan and NHS People Promise for our estates and facilities workforce across England over the next 10 years. It highlights 4 priorities:\\n\\nThe apprenticeship challenge was launched in 2022 to create 1,000 apprenticeship starts in estates and facilities each financial year.\\n\\nAn apprenticeship toolkit specific to estates and facilities has been developed to support this challenge, and can be used to explore different apprenticeships, find example career pathways, understand how to fund apprenticeships and develop the team.\\n\\nICSs have a critical role in driving efforts to improve population health and tackle inequalities in their local areas.The unemployed are more than five times as likely to be in poor health than those in employment ( the Health Foundation, 2022). ICS estates and facilities can help deliver better health outcomes in local communities by increasing levels of employment in deprived areas, and offering training and development through apprenticeships and widening participation initiatives.\\n\\nIn the Delivering a net zero NHS report the NHS committed to reach net zero by 2040 for the carbon emissions it controls directly, and by 2045 for those it can influence (such as those embodied within the supply chain).\\n\\nGreen plans provide a structured way for each trust and ICS to set out the carbon reduction initiatives it has underway and plans for the next 3 years (for this cycle, 2022/23 to 2024/25). The 3-year timeframe should allow green plans to strike an appropriate balance between immediate carbon reductions in some areas, alongside strategic development of capability in others. All  green plans should reflect national priorities by aligning with the plans, actions and timescales laid out in Delivering a net zero NHS.\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>Okay, the browsing results from Action 3 provided useful information.\nThe RAND PDF didn't define NHS IIP or its economic model/ROI.

However, it must be recognised that failure, design flaws or incorrect use of such systems has the potential to cause harm to those patients that the system is intending to benefit.\\n\\nEnsuring patient safety and data security in healthcare is paramount. This includes complying with various regulations set forth by governing bodies within digital health. Regulatory compliance is a critical aspect that digital health manufacturers and healthcare organisations must navigate to maintain the highest standards of care and reduction in risk of harm to patients.\\n\\n**Understanding Regulatory Compliance**\\n\\nRegulatory compliance refers to adhering to a set of guidelines, rules, and standards established by the NHS and other relevant external authorities. These regulations encompass a wide range of areas, including patient safety, data privacy and security, medical device usage, and more.\\n\\nThe primary goal of regulatory compliance is to ensure that healthcare services are delivered safely, efficiently, and ethically supported by digital health systems.\\n\\nThe Digital Technology Assessment Framework (DTAC) provides the means to assess digital health systems and their compliance with a number of standards and regulations that are encompassed into five categories:\\n\\n**Key Components of Digital Health Regulatory Compliance within the NHS**\\n\\nPatient/Clinical Safety: DCB0129 Clinical Risk Management: its Application in the Manufacturer of Health IT Systems ensures that patient safety is upheld through proper procedures, processes, and digital health system usage. This safeguards patients from avoidable harm or errors. Medical devices used in healthcare settings must adhere to specific regulations to guarantee their safety and efficacy. In the UK this means complying with the UK MDR 2002 (UKCA)\\n\\nData Protection: Protecting patient information is of utmost importance. Regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data Security and Protection Toolkit and ISO27001 dictate how clinical information should be collected, stored, and processed securely.\\n\\nTechnical Security: Technical security, also known as cybersecurity, refers to the measures and practices implemented to protect digital health systems, networks, data, and digital assets from various cyber threats, attacks, and unauthorised access. It encompasses a wide range of strategies and technologies designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital resources.\\n\\nCyber Essentials is one of the requirements in relation to technical security. Cyber Essentials helps you to guard against the most common cyber threats and demonstrate your commitment to cyber security.\\n\\nInteroperability: Interoperability refers to the ability of digital health systems, devices, applications, or components to work together and exchange information in a safe and effective manner. In the context of technology and information systems, interoperability ensures that disparate systems can communicate, share data, and perform tasks collaboratively, even if they are developed by different vendors or have different functions.\\n\\nApplication Programme Interfaces (API) are used to support interoperability with other systems and should adhere to best practice and guidance.\\n\\nUsability and Accessibility: Usability refers to the ease with which users can interact with a digital health system, or service to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. A usable design is intuitive, user-friendly, and minimises the cognitive load required to complete tasks. Usability is often evaluated through user testing, user feedback, and observation of user behaviour.\\n\\nDigital health manufacturers need to be aware of the NHS service standard which helps address the differing needs of the health service users when delivering digital services into healthcare.\\n\\nAccessibility focuses on designing products, services, and digital content in a way that ensures they are usable by people with disabilities. This involves making adjustments to accommodate individuals who might have visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. Accessibility aims to provide equal access and opportunities for all users, regardless of their abilities.\\n\\n**NHS Regulatory Compliance is an Essential Pillar of Healthcare Operations.**\\n\\nAdherence to these regulations ensures patient safety, data security, and overall quality of care. Working collaboratively with the Clinical Safety Officer and your digital team will help you navigate the regulatory compliance process, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: delivering high quality clinical services while safeguarding the well-being of patients.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to attending Digital Health Rewired 2025, the must-attend event for anyone passionate about digital transformation in healthcare.

The legislation gave NHS foundation trusts new freedoms, with trust boards having more autonomy to make financial and strategic decisions. In this new regime, the Trust Board are ultimately and collectively responsible for the financial performance and quality of healthcare delivery of their foundation trust.\\n\\n1.2 Foundation Trusts are required to operate within their terms of authorisation issued by Monitor. In order to monitor Foundation Trust’s compliance with their terms of authorisation, Monitor has developed a Compliance Framework, which is updated each year. There are three components to the Compliance Framework:\\n\\nAnnual risk assessment; In-year monitoring; and Intervention.\\n\\n1.3 The Trust aims to be a leader in governance process and practice and as such, has developed this policy in order to ensure that it meets best practice in the sector and adheres to the Compliance Framework at all times.2.1 The purpose of this procedure is to:\\n\\nSet out responsibilities and procedures for adherence to Monitor’s Compliance Framework\\n\\nProvide assurance to the Board that robust processes are in place, and are followed in practice\\n\\nProvide guidance to staff involved in the process regarding their responsibilities and issues subject to reporting\\n\\nPromote an open and transparent relationship with Monitor, and relevant third parties\\n\\n3.1 This policy covers all aspects of the Compliance Framework set out in Monitor’s Compliance Framework 2010/11, and all aspects of the Trust’s activity.\\n\\nThe policy will be updated on an annual basis following the annual revision of the Compliance Framework.\\n\\n4.1 A number of committees/individuals within the organisation have duties relevant to this policy:\\n\\nThe Trust Board is accountable for the performance of the Trust and for ensuring that the Trust complies with its Terms of Authorisation.\\n\\nThe Trust Board will review and approve submissions to Monitor, providing appropriate challenge to ensure that reporting requirements are met and substantial assurance is provided.\\n\\nThe Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing financial controls, and also reviews the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of integrated governance, risk management and internal control, across the whole of the organisation’s activities.As part of the Internal Audit Strategic Plan, Internal audit will carry out an annual review of the Trust’s arrangements for adhering to the Compliance Framework and report this to the Audit Committee.\\n\\nThe Audit Committee will identify any financial control issues reportable to Monitor in accordance with this policy, and report these to the Board.\\n\\nThe Finance, Business and Investment Committee has responsibility to scrutinise current financial performance and future financial plans, review financial and business risks, and review proposals for major service developments.\\n\\nThe Finance, Business and Investment Committee will identify any financial performance or investment issues reportable to Monitor in accordance with this policy, and report these to the Board.\\n\\nThe Assurance Committee has responsibility of reviewing and monitoring the Board Assurance Framework (high level risk register) on behalf of the Board.\\n\\nThe Assurance Committee will identify any (non-financial) control issues reportable to Monitor in accordance with this policy, and report these to the Board.\\n\\nThe Chief Executive is the Accountable Officer of the Trust and will certify Board statements and other submissions in accordance with Monitor requirements. The Chief Executive is responsible for reporting the results of Monitor assessments to the Members Council.The Director of Finance is the Chief Financial Officer of the Trust and is responsible for identifying issues and preparing submissions in accordance with this policy. The Director of Finance has a key role with the Monitor Relationship Management Team, as well as internal and external audit.\\n\\nThe Director of Performance and Business Development is responsible for the Trust’s performance management system, as well as the development of the annual plan and individual service developments.\\n\\nThe Director of Performance & Business Development is the executive director with lead responsibility for engagement with the Monitor Relationship Management Team, for ensuring that proper reporting takes place in accordance with this procedure, and that proper records are kept.\\n\\nThe Director of Nursing & Quality has Board level responsibility for the Trust’s Healthcare Governance Framework and Assurance functions, including registration with the Care Quality Commission.\\n\\nThe Associate Director of Governance supports the Director of Performance & Business Development and other executive directors and committees in accordance with their roles set out above.\\n\\nThe Associate Director of Governance is responsible for the development and maintenance of this policy, and as Secretary to the Trust Board and its committees, advising them of Monitor guidance and other governance issues.4.2 The Members Council does not have any responsibilities under this policy, but will receive reports from the Chief Executive regarding the results of Monitor assessments. Monitor will also notify the Members Council of any formal intervention, and may communicate directly with them.\\n\\n5.1.1 Monitor’s Compliance Framework is designed to enable NHS Foundation Trusts to innovate, respond to local wishes and provide better healthcare. Monitor will maintain an environment conducive to innovation by focusing on providing a regulatory platform that ensures NHS Foundation Trusts maintain their viability: staying solvent, governing themselves effectively within their constitution, engaging with patients, service users and commissioners, providing all the services that they are required to deliver by law, and complying with other conditions set out in their authorisation.\\n\\n5.1.2 Monitor will not involve itself in determining healthcare strategy or operational policies in NHS Foundation Trusts.\\n\\n5.1.3 The following principles shape Monitor’s approach to regulation:\\n\\nSelf-regulation: Boards are responsible for ensuring that NHS Foundation Trusts comply with their Authorisation and statutory obligations at all times;Proportionality: Monitor takes a risk-based approach to regulation, intervening only when necessary. The intensity of Monitoring of an NHS Foundation Trust is guided by the risk of a significant breach of their Authorisation;\\n\\nTransparency: Monitor will use a transparent method for assessing risks to compliance, as set out in the regulatory framework;\\n\\nTrust-based approach: Monitor expects NHS Foundation Trusts to disclose issues speedily and candidly. Monitor will seek to adopt a collaborative approach to resolve issues before considering intervention; Confidentiality: Monitor will not, unless it has a statutory obligation to do so, disclose confidential information without prior agreement;\\n\\nMinimal duplication of regulation: Monitor will not usually act where other bodies have a lead regulatory role unless they have exhausted their powers and an NHS Foundation Trust still risks a breach of their Authorisation; and\\n\\nMinimal information requirements: Monitor aims to minimise the information requirements it places on NHS Foundation Trusts. Its requirements should in any case be a sub-set of the information requires to discharge its functions effectively.\\n\\n5.1.4 There are three components to the Compliance Framework:\\n\\nAnnual risk assessment; In-year monitoring; and Intervention.5.1.5 For both annual risk assessment and in-year monitoring, Monitor will assign a risk rating in two areas – finance and governance (including mandatory goods and services). Monitor will use these ratings to guide the intensity of its monitoring and signal to the NHS Foundation Trust its degree of concern with specific or a range of issues identified and evaluated.\\n\\n5.2.1 By 31 May each year, NHS Foundation Trusts are required to submit an annual plan to Monitor. Requirements for the content of the annual plan are set out in the publication Annual Plan: Advice for NHS Foundation Trusts, which is updated annually by Monitor.\\n\\n5.2.2 Monitor will assess the risks identified in the annual plan and assign a risk rating in two areas – finance and governance.\\n\\n5.3.1 NHS Foundation Trusts will need to provide three types of in-year reports:\\n\\nRegular reports including in-year data submissions and audited\\n\\nannual report and accounts\\n\\nException reports, which may relate to any in-year issue affecting\\n\\ncompliance with the Authorisation\\n\\nAd hoc reports, at Monitor’s request5.4.1 If Monitor is satisfied that an NHS Foundation Trust is failing to comply with its Authorisation, or any requirement it has under any relevant legislation, and that the failure is “significant”, or that the Trust is likely to repeat an earlier significant failing, Monitor has the power to intervene by:\\n\\nRequiring the Trust to do, or not to do, specific things within a selected period;\\n\\nRemoving any or all of the directors or council members, and appointing interim directors or council members;\\n\\nRequiring the Trust to take steps to obtain a moratorium or make proposals for a voluntary arrangement; and\\n\\nObtaining an order transferring the property and liabilities of the Trust to another NHS body and/or providing for the dissolution of the NHS Foundation Trust.\\n\\n6.1.1 The Director of Performance & Business Development has responsibility for the annual planning process.\\n\\n6.1.2 The process normally begins in November each year, and the Trust consults with the Members Council and the membership on its draft plans, and the draft annual plan will normally be submitted to the Trust Board in March.\\n\\n6.1.3 The final annual plan will be approved by the Trust Board and submitted to Monitor by 31 May.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-and-risk-assessment-in-the-nhs/risk-management-and-risk-assessment-in-the-nhs\",\n    \"query\": \"risk assessment metrics and mitigation strategies NHS healthcare investment\",\n    \"content\": \"We use some essential cookies to make this website work.\\n\\nWe’d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your settings and improve government services.\\n\\nWe also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.\\n\\nYou have accepted additional cookies.

It's variously referred to as a cost of equity, a loan and a return on investment. At a 3.5% interest rate though, its cost is comparable to the regulated cost of capital on commercially owned, regulated infrastructure such as energy networks and Thames Tideway Tunnel, which vary from 2.69% to 2.85% real weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and 2.5% real bid WACC, respectively.\\n\\nThis is substantially higher, though, than the cost of UK borrowing, with National Loan Fund rates varying from almost zero to 1.\",\n          \"date\": \"Jun 4, 2021\",\n          \"attributes\": {\n            \"Missing\": \"(IIP) | Show results with:(IIP)\"\n          },\n          \"position\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Return on investment of public health interventions: a systematic ...\",\n          \"link\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537512/\",\n          \"snippet\": \"The benefits of population-level public health expenditure—unlike those of personal healthcare and social care expenditure—tend to be long term, mostly accruing after the current politicians and policymakers have moved on.

The CBR is the benefit divided by the cost, and the ROI is the benefit minus the cost expressed as a proportion of the cost, that is, the CBR−1.

Howard Davis looks at the state of healthcare infrastructure.\\n\\nToo often, government policy ignores social infrastructure when setting out investment plans. But the last year has shown the critical importance of the NHS, and therefore, its infrastructure to the economy.\\n\\nWhile direct spending on NHS capital has increased, the government has also shut down other methods for the NHS to fund health infrastructure. Reducing capital charges would help the NHS system to invest and boost the economy’s recovery.\\n\\nWorking in social infrastructure often makes you feel like the poor cousin of the heady world of transport, telecoms and energy infrastructure. Government plans usually focus on these industries as 'investment' rather than 'spending' departments.\\n\\nThe government’s first long-term infrastructure plan ignored health and social infrastructure entirely. That’s been fixed now and the UK National Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2016 to 2021 devoted three paragraphs to healthcare on page 79.Since then, the government has made the welcome announcement to invest in 46 new hospital schemes, although the last six of these are not included in the most-recent budget papers. This shows a commitment to an increased budget for NHS infrastructure.\\n\\nThe capital budget has already increased to between £8.5-9.5 billion pa over the next two years, as part of a broader commitment to invest £600 billion in infrastructure more generally over the next five years. This is a significant commitment and key part of \\\"building back better\\\".\\n\\nHealthcare represents 10% of the UK economy and the NHS is 78% of that. This is larger than transport, energy or telecommunications. The sector underpins key, government-targeted growth sectors like life sciences, research and education. It's a knowledge industry, with highly qualified people developing new products and innovations every day.\\n\\nNot to mention, healthcare is a fundamental ingredient and enabler of economic productivity. Put simply, you can’t work if you're ill. Healthcare therefore drives growth, employment and productivity in the broader economy.This isn't, however, possible without high-quality NHS infrastructure. This requires public sector investment, because the NHS represents 78% of the British healthcare sector.\\n\\nThe NHS annual depreciation bill is around £3.5 billion. This is based on historical values and probably understates the investment needed to maintain the status quo.\\n\\nFactoring in the increases in construction costs over the last 10-15 years, just maintaining the status quo could cost £10 billion per annum. This is without bringing NHS infrastructure up to modern standards and implementing NHS plans to improve services.\\n\\nAccording to NHS returns, backlog maintenance sits at a further £9 billion. Trusts have reported incidents as alarming as walls caving in and ceilings collapsing in active wards, not to mention leaks in theatres.\\n\\nThese same Trusts are attempting to lure international life sciences companies and renowned academics to come work with them to develop cutting-edge research and treatments, which could drive significant economic growth. That's an immeasurably more difficult task when the estate that those Trusts are demonstrating to investors is not up to world-class standards.It's clear that supporting the economy and driving life-sciences investment requires significant capital just to bring NHS infrastructure up to an acceptable level.\\n\\nThe government’s commitment to increased funding is helpful, but it needs to be seen in context, based on three areas:\\n\\nThis situation follows a sustained period where:\\n\\nIn other words, there's a great deal of catching up to do before the government can say that it's contributing to real improvements.\\n\\nThe cost of NHS infrastructure has substantially increased. We estimate by 2.5 to 3 times per square metre in the last eight to ten years. So, the cost of bringing hospitals up to scratch is significantly greater than before.\\n\\nFinally, non-budgetary sources of funds have been effectively shut down. This commitment of public sector funding also comes with a virtual ban on any private sector investment or borrowing by the NHS.\\n\\nLocal NHS organisations have worked up a number of innovative development schemes, especially in metropolitan areas, where private land developers are willing to cross subsidise NHS hospital development in exchange for land deals.These deals would stimulate investment, not only in the NHS, but in life sciences and the broader economy. However, regulators have resisted these deals, because of concerns that they breach the Chancellor’s 2019 commitment to end private finance in healthcare\\n\\nAt the same time, the Independent Trust Financing Facility, which allowed Trusts to borrow for capital development, has also been effectively closed down.\\n\\nAll this means that, where NHS providers previously had three avenues for accessing capital, they now have just one: the government capital budget or, in the terminology of the NHS, Public Dividend Capital (PDC), and that comes at a cost.\\n\\nIn order to access capital, NHS organisations need to develop a business case to demonstrate that the new hospital developments are affordable and good value for money. That’s where PDC comes in.\\n\\nNHS Trusts are expected to make a return on the capital invested by the system each year. This 'PDC charge' of 3.5% pa is basically a cost of capital charged on Trust net assets (more or less) and was conceived when the aspiration was for a free internal market with Trusts having autonomy over investment decisions.The sense was that a cost of capital was necessary in order for Trusts to consider the long-term costs and benefits of those investments. Now, however, the internal market has waned. Trust autonomy over investments has been effectively eliminated and the business case process gives the centre the ability to scrutinise every major capital investment.\\n\\nThe effect of PDC is that, for every £100 million invested in new NHS infrastructure, Trusts need to find £3.5 million of efficiencies each year. This is over and above the annual efficiency factors imposed on pricing by the centre, and over and above the need to depreciate the new, higher value asset.\\n\\nThe narrative around what the PDC charge represents is confused. It's variously referred to as a cost of equity, a loan and a return on investment. At a 3.5% interest rate though, its cost is comparable to the regulated cost of capital on commercially owned, regulated infrastructure such as energy networks and Thames Tideway Tunnel, which vary from 2.69% to 2.85% real weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and 2.5% real bid WACC, respectively.This is substantially higher, though, than the cost of UK borrowing, with National Loan Fund rates varying from almost zero to 1.5%. The 3.5% cost of capital seemed a reasonable number when it was first developed in the 1990s, when:\\n\\nIn the 90s, the service had not been through the repeated productivity challenges of the last ten years. The NHS has been asked to deliver pricing efficiencies of between 1% and 4%, annually. This is an efficiency challenge that accumulates to 35% since 2004.\\n\\nNow, however, this requirement to pay capital charges has become a deterrent to investment by the NHS, putting up a significant barrier for financially strapped trusts. This undermines the government’s objectives for an infrastructure-led recovery and threatens the NHS’s ability to play its part in stimulating growth in health and life sciences industries.\\n\\nNHS providers have been unable to fully meet the system’s productivity challenges since 2014/15, let alone an additional productivity challenge imposed by investment in capital. That means that the investment, which the government wants to see and will contribute to an infrastructure-led recovery, will be difficult for Trusts to afford.In 2019, half of NHS providers were in deficit and, even after additional central funding of £2.4 billion, the sector was in deficit by over £800 million. This deficit is after deduction of £647 million of PDC capital charges; a figure that might be lower than you would expect for a service with a total provider income of £85 billion.\\n\\nThat’s because, for the providers in the greatest deficit position, deficits have so eroded net assets that there is no charge to pay because they have negative net assets. Among these Trusts will be many operating dilapidated and expensive buildings, which:\\n\\nFor these Trusts, paying 3.5% pa on new capital is difficult, if not impossible, to fund. This effectively denies them the investment that just might unlock their performance issues and bring them out of a vicious downward spiral.\\n\\nIt could also deny the government an important part of the broader infrastructure boom that it's attempting to unlock. It certainly makes Trusts less competitive in the international market for talent and investment.Reducing or eliminating the PDC charge is one way to make investment more achievable for NHS providers. Originally conceived as a way to ration capital and incentivise good decisions around what to fund in an internal market, it has been superseded by a highly structured business case process and virtual total central control of major funding decisions.\\n\\nIts level was set in a completely different interest rate environment and in an environment where Trusts were significantly more affluent. There is a strong case for change and this will have positive knock-on effects, beyond high quality patient care, into economic performance of the UK economy as a whole.\\n\\nTo discuss these issues further, get in touch with Howard Davis.\\n\\nSubscribe\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455893/RAF_revised_25_August.pdf\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS risk assessment metrics for healthcare investment\",\n    \"content\": \"Failed to get the website\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/An_exemplar_operational_risk_management_strategy.pdf\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS risk mitigation strategies for healthcare investment\",\n    \"content\": \"Failed to get the website\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The previous browsing attempt (Action 7) for IIP definition and RAF PDF failed.

National Clinical Audits of practice and service evaluations are not research. However, product development activities may be research. The HRA provides a tool to help you work out whether what you are doing is research and, if it is, what approvals will be required.\\n\\nIt is important to bear in mind that this definition of research is a specific subset of the definition of research used by the ICO used in a data protection legislation context. The latter definition applies to determine whether the research provisions and requirements about safeguards that can be found in the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 apply in any specific case. For more information, see the ICO’s new guidance on research provisions within the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 that will give more advice on the application of data protection legislation provisions for processing personal data for research purposes.For the purposes of this guidance, it is important to note that these two definitions of research are not mutually exclusive as the two regimes apply concurrently. Activities that meet the criteria of research under the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research will also meet the broader definition of research used by the ICO. However, activities that are not managed as research under the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research may still fall within research as defined by the ICO.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\nThe Health Research Authority (HRA) manages health and social care research approvals, Research Ethics Committees (RECs), and the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) in England.\\n\\nHRA Approval brings together the assessment of research governance and legal compliance with independent research ethics review. If your project involves research using health and care information that relates to identified or identifiable individuals, obtained from local NHS organisations or adult social care service providers, you normally need research approvals including HRA Approval. Application for HRA Approval is through the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS).A clinical investigation of a medical device is research so you will require HRA Approval if this is conducted within the NHS in England. Development of in-house medical devices may involve research. If so, you will need to obtain appropriate research approvals.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates medical devices in the UK and determines if a product is a medical device. It has published detailed guidance on how to comply with legal requirements concerning medical devices. You can also contact the MHRA regulatory inbox at [devices.regulatory@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:devices.regulatory@mhra.gov.uk) if you want to confirm whether your product is a medical device or not.\\n\\nMHRA guidance provides that accessories to devices are treated as if they are medical devices and all the relevant requirements will apply. Data-sets placed on the market as an accessory to a medical device will need to fulfil all the relevant regulatory requirements.If your data-driven technology does not have a medical purpose as defined by the MHRA and is not a medical device, it does not need to be regulated by the MHRA. However, the law governing the use of personal data or confidential patient information, and the requirement to seek HRA Approval for research using health and care information obtained from local NHS organisations or adult social care service providers, apply in the same way whether the technology is classed as a medical device or not.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\nIf you are a manufacturer of data-driven technology that is a medical device, you must obtain a CE (European Conformity) – now UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) - mark before the device can be deployed in clinical care. You will need to carry out a clinical investigation of the device to demonstrate safety and performance, unless you can do so by other means. You must notify the MHRA before the medical device is made available to a medical practitioner for clinical investigation.If your medical device is only intended for use with patients and service users within your organisation and you do not intend to commercialise the product, there is currently no need to obtain a UKCA mark, as in-house medical devices are exempt. If you later intend to transfer the medical device developed in-house to other organisations for use in direct care only, or use it for direct care on patients and service users outside your organisation, or commercialise it, you will need to obtain a UKCA mark.\\n\\nPatient or service user data accessed for the generation of clinical evidence for UKCA marking requires a clinical investigation registered with the MHRA through IRAS. Ethics approval should be sought through the HRA and provided by a REC. Devices should be labelled “exclusively for clinical investigations”.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced a standards framework for digital health technologies that describes the evidence for effectiveness standards that different classes of medical devices need to achieve. Not complying with this framework may affect the reimbursement you receive.\\n\\nGo back to the checklistBefore being deployed in the NHS, data-driven technology that is a health IT system must conform to the requirements of NHS Digital clinical risk-management standards in the manufacture and deployment of health IT systems.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\nThe development and deployment of data-driven technologies intended for the health and care system should ideally comply with the Department of Health and Social Care guide to good practice for digital and data-driven health and care technologies. The guide encourages technology companies to meet a gold-standard set of principles to protect data to the highest standards. The guide provides evidence of what good practice looks like, thereby reassuring patients, service users, and clinicians that data-driven technology is safe, effective and maintains privacy. It also aims to make sure that the NHS gets a fair deal from the commercialisation of its data resources.\\n\\nGo back to the checklist\\n\\n5) Definitions (Alphabetical)# 4) Checklist - Standards, codes, and approvals## 4.1 Checklist## Have you considered whether the development/deployment of the technology is classified as research?## **Do you have appropriate approvals in place if it is classified as research?**## Have you considered whether the technology is a medical device and notified the MHRA if so?## If you are a manufacturer have you ensured that a CE or UKCA mark has been obtained if required?## Does the technology conform to the NICE standards framework?## Does the technology conform to the requirements of NHS Digital Clinical Risk Management and Deployment of health IT systems standards?## Does the technology conform to the Guide to Good Practice for Digital and Data-Driven Health Technologies?## Site map\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/nhs-capital-investment-key-considerations-for-getting-it-right\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS healthcare investment risk mitigation techniques\",\n    \"content\": \"17 October 2024\\n\\n\\nFor much of the government’s first 100 days in office, we heard a strong message of fiscal restraint. Yet as Rachel Reeves prepares to deliver her first Budget as Chancellor, reports suggest she is considering modifying the government’s fiscal rules, which could allow more borrowing for public sector investment. Reeves emphasised that ‘investment is the solution’, indicating that the government now considers investment part of the remedy for the UK's stagnant economic growth.\\n\\nThe NHS is in need of urgent investment. A major theme highlighted by the recent independent Darzi review is the role the lack of long-term investment in capital has played in deteriorating performance levels. Hospital buildings are crumbling; latest figures show the backlog maintenance stands at £13.8bn, over £2.7bn of which is considered high risk; IT infrastructure is not fit for purpose, and NHS productivity is low, having not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.Recognition that the NHS needs capital investment is not new. The previous government introduced the New Hospital Programme in 2020, promising 40 new hospitals by 2030. This has now been paused for review, after the first 3 years were beset by challenges and uncertainties, including about funding sources, approaches to construction and whether the new hospitals were genuinely ‘new’ or indeed hospitals.\\n\\nWith so many areas of the NHS in dire need of capital investment, the new government is right to review the programme to ensure that resources can deliver value for money. But how can policymakers be sure that NHS capital funding is invested in the right way and in the right places? Here, we highlight five key considerations.\\n\\nInvestment needs to be based on an objective assessment of those areas of the NHS where the need for capital funding is greatest.\\n\\nWith safety risks posed by crumbling infrastructure, slow progress towards full digitisation of health records and a lower number of scanners and medical equipment per population than most EU comparators, capital funding must target areas where need is greatest. This is both to account for current needs but also based on an assessment of projected longer term needs that ought to be planned for now.Robust evidence on the most effective geographical and organisational structure of NHS infrastructure is surprisingly sparse. Is it specialisation that matters for better care, or access to more modern facilities and technologies? Is it volume of activity, to allow for staff to learn by doing – consider complex surgical skills for instance – or to achieve economies of scale whereby larger infrastructures make better technology more affordable?\\n\\nEvaluations of previous initiatives to reorganise hospital care, such as the centralisation of stroke services in London or the creation of a ‘super-trust’ in Manchester, have shown mixed impacts. While some studies have found positive outcomes, others have detailed operational challenges, with deteriorating quality where capacity was disrupted.\\n\\nSimilarly, waves of hospital mergers in England in past decades have been met with scepticism, given the lack of systematic evidence that they significantly boosted productivity, quality or the financial situation of hospital trusts. Where performance did improve, it is unclear why and how this could be replicated.\\n\\nDrawing on the albeit limited evidence of what has and hasn’t worked well should be a vital consideration before major investment programmes are initiated.As more detailed data become available, research shows that staff expertise and experience and better staff engagement can help improve patient outcomes. But staff need buildings that are fit for purpose, the right tools and equipment and processes that support their work, if they are to deliver high-quality care for patients. Investing in capital and improving working conditions for staff must go hand in hand. So too should investing in high-quality management to ensure resources are used effectively.\\n\\nThe NHS Long Term Workforce Plan does recognise the interdependencies between investing in the workforce and capital investment, as well as across sectors of care (inside and outside of hospitals), although the investment that would be needed was not accounted for in the plan. So far, the New Hospital Programme has focused on infrastructure alone, rather than an integrated approach for how new buildings can be combined with other forms of capital and workforce to deliver better care.Streamlining care within hospitals or expanding existing capacity may also be a promising way of investing in the NHS. For instance, recent evaluation of elective surgical hubs, an NHS initiative to ringfence resources and staff to the treatment of low-complexity cases for high-volume planned surgeries, such as hip replacements, shows this led to a significant increase in the volume of procedures carried out, compared with comparable hospital sites without elective surgical hubs.\\n\\nAlternatively, investing in other models of care might be another potentially more effective way of improving the delivery of care inside and outside hospitals. ‘Virtual wards’ are an example of schemes that aim to provide hospital care in patients’ homes, but evidence on their benefits to date is quite limited. Recent research highlights the need for better data to really assess whether virtual wards could deliver their expected benefits and reduce pressure on hospital capacity.\\n\\nRelying on solid evidence of the most effective models of care and recognising that each is context specific could help to yield greater impact with the funding available.Population health varies across and within regions, yet health care services tend to be scarcer in areas that need them the most, a phenomenon dubbed the inverse care law. There is some evidence that the initial New Hospital Programme proposals may have reinforced this pattern.\\n\\nHealth inequalities are stark and projected to persist. Any large-scale capital investment in the NHS should therefore carefully consider the local context to ensure they benefit populations that need it most. Beyond directly providing access to care, hospitals are also considered anchor institutions, bringing wider economic benefits and opportunities to their local area.\\n\\nOverall, the NHS is in critical need of capital investment and the upcoming Budget is a key test of how committed the new government is to getting the NHS back on its feet. In the meantime, the government’s decision to review the New Hospital Programme makes sense. Ensuring that the available money is invested in a way that delivers the most value for patients – and takes into account entrenched health inequalities – should be at the heart of any well thought out capital investment plan.\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nThe Health Foundation has been tracking the new government’s health and care policy choices. 100...\\n\\nPress releaseAnita Charlesworth, Director of Research and the REAL Centre at the Health Foundation, comments on...\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nMelissa Co looks at the challenges to evidence for virtual wards – and what can be done about them.\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nOur evaluation provides evidence that NHS elective surgical hubs can significantly increase...\\n\\nShare this page:\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nBryan Jones and Tim Horton look at the challenges to ensuring incentives are successful and make a...\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nHow can decision makers without analytical training arrive at a first, and rough, judgement about...\\n\\nReceive the latest news and updates\\n\\nfrom the Health Foundation\\n\\nCopyright The Health Foundation 2025.

Please wait a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The UK's National Health Service (NHS) utilizes various funding schemes to drive investment in healthcare infrastructure, technology, and services. Understanding the economic models, return on investment (ROI) patterns, regulatory frameworks, and risk assessment strategies associated with these schemes is crucial for evaluating their effectiveness and ensuring successful implementation. This analysis explores these aspects across different NHS funding mechanisms, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), the Mutual Investment Model (MIM), and broader infrastructure and investment initiatives.\n\n### Economic Models and Return on Investment (ROI)\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a key metric used to evaluate the financial benefits of healthcare Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives and investments, traditionally applied in the commercial sector. While the concept is increasingly used in healthcare, understanding its application within the NHS requires considering both monetary and non-monetary benefits.\n\nDifferent investment models within the NHS exhibit varying ROI patterns:\n\n*   **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Private Finance Initiative (PFI):** PPPs, including the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), have been employed to provide innovative approaches to healthcare facilities and services. However, PFI schemes have faced scrutiny regarding their economic case. Total costs for hospitals built under PFI have been estimated to be significantly higher (18-60%) than construction costs alone, with shareholders expecting substantial real returns (15-25% per year). The fees charged to the NHS by consortiums involved in these schemes can be substantial (11.2-18.5% of construction costs). This contrasts sharply with the lower real annual interest rate (3.0-3.5%) the Treasury would pay for direct borrowing. While PPPs are expected to play a role in modernizing infrastructure and addressing maintenance backlogs, the economic benefits compared to public financing have been questioned.\n*   **Mutual Investment Model (MIM):** The MIM is another approach fostering investment in public infrastructure, including healthcare. MIM schemes in Wales are expected to facilitate significant investment, with reports indicating over a billion pounds worth of much-needed public investment. While the specific ROI patterns for MIM in healthcare are not detailed in the provided information, the model aims to attract investment for infrastructure development.\n*   **Public Health Interventions:** Investing in public health interventions demonstrates a strong ROI. A systematic review indicated a median ROI of approximately 14:1 for public health interventions, meaning for every £1 invested, £14 is returned to the wider health and social care economy. This highlights the financial benefits of preventing ill health compared to treating it later.\n*   **Quality Improvement (QI) Programmes:** ROI in healthcare QI is increasingly being used to evaluate financial benefits. The concept of QI-ROI encompasses any valued benefit, monetary or non-monetary, derived from QI initiatives. Studies have attempted to quantify the ROI of specific QI interventions, such as the Productive Ward initiative, which estimated a return of £8.07 for every £1 spent. Evaluating investment in QI capacity building has also shown positive returns, with one study reporting a return of $1.77 for every $1 invested in training.\n*   **Medical Technology (MedTech) Adoption:** The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) policy aims to accelerate the uptake of selected innovative medical devices, diagnostics, and digital products that are clinically effective and cost-saving within three years. Technologies supported by the MTFM are expected to generate a return on investment. For example, the Heartflow technology generated over £2.2 million in savings in one year, contributing to a total of £5 million in savings while under MTFM support. SecurAcath also achieved estimated savings of £2.5 million in 2021/22. The Health Technology Adoption and Acceleration Fund (HTAAF) has invested £30 million to support the adoption of innovative medical technology, aiming to improve patient care and potentially generate efficiencies.\n*   **Infrastructure Investment:** Investment in NHS infrastructure is considered vital for economic recovery and enabling the delivery of modern, digitally enabled patient care. However, the Public Dividend Capital (PDC) charge, a cost of capital applied to NHS Trusts' net assets, can act as a deterrent to investment, requiring trusts to find efficiencies to cover the charge. This charge, currently at 3.5% per annum, is comparable to the cost of capital for commercially owned regulated infrastructure but substantially higher than the cost of UK government borrowing. Reducing or eliminating the PDC charge is suggested as a way to make investment more achievable for NHS providers.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements and Compliance Frameworks\n\nNHS funding schemes and the adoption of new technologies and infrastructure are subject to various regulatory requirements and compliance frameworks to ensure patient safety, data security, and effective governance.\n\nKey aspects of the regulatory landscape include:\n\n*   **Digital Health Regulatory Compliance:** The deployment of Digital Health Systems within the NHS requires strict adherence to guidelines, rules, and standards established by the NHS and other relevant authorities. This is crucial for patient safety and data security. The Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) is a national baseline for digital health technologies, assessing compliance with standards in clinical safety, data protection, technical security, interoperability, and usability and accessibility. Manufacturers and adopters of digital health technologies must navigate regulations such as the UK MDR 2002 (UKCA) for medical devices, GDPR for data protection, and Cyber Essentials for technical security.\n*   **Infrastructure Development Compliance:** Developing NHS infrastructure involves adherence to regulations related to planning, funding, and environmental impact. Guidance exists for Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) to develop 10-year infrastructure strategies, which must align with national drivers such as delivering a 'Net Zero' NHS. Funding mechanisms for infrastructure may involve developer contributions, utilizing frameworks like the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) or Section 106 obligations.\n*   **Provider Licensing and Monitoring:** Independent sector providers of NHS services are required to hold an NHS provider licence and comply with its conditions. NHS England (which assumed regulatory responsibilities from Monitor) is responsible for licensing and monitoring these providers, including financial and quality governance oversight.\n*   **Research and Innovation Approvals:** Research and innovation activities within the NHS, particularly those involving patient data or clinical investigations, require specific approvals. The Health Research Authority (HRA) manages health and social care research approvals, including ethical review and assessment of governance and legal compliance. Clinical investigations of medical devices require notification to the MHRA and may need HRA approval if conducted within the NHS.\n*   **MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) Criteria:** Technologies supported by the MTFM must meet specific criteria, including being clinically effective, cost-saving within three years (as determined by NICE), and affordable to the NHS. Compliance with NICE guidance is essential for technologies seeking MTFM support.\n\n### Risk Assessment Metrics and Mitigation Strategies\n\nRisk assessment and management are integral to healthcare investments within the UK NHS system to identify potential challenges and implement strategies to mitigate them.\n\nKey aspects of risk assessment and mitigation include:\n\n*   **Integrated Risk Management:** NHS organizations are encouraged to integrate risk management across governance, finance, and clinical areas. This involves reviewing risk management arrangements, reporting risks to the board, and establishing effective systems of integrated governance, risk management, and internal control.\n*   **Risk Assessment Frameworks:** NHS England utilizes risk assessment frameworks to assess the compliance of NHS foundation trusts and independent sector providers with their licence conditions, particularly regarding financial sustainability and governance. These frameworks involve annual risk assessments, in-year monitoring, and potential intervention if significant failures in compliance are identified.\n*   **Financial Risk:** Financial risks in the NHS include the challenging financial environment, increasing estate costs, and the need to achieve financial targets (control totals). Investment in IT infrastructure is seen as necessary to achieve long-term strategies and address financial risks through potential efficiencies. The PDC charge on capital investment also represents a financial risk for trusts, potentially hindering necessary infrastructure development.\n*   **Clinical Risk:** Digital health systems, while offering benefits, also pose potential clinical risks if there are failures, design flaws, or incorrect use. Regulatory compliance, particularly with standards like DCB0129 for clinical risk management in health IT systems, is a key mitigation strategy to safeguard patients from avoidable harm.\n*   **Operational Risk:** A sound operational risk management strategy is vital for trusts to manage the dangers of operational risks and ensure that investment proposals are developed and evaluated effectively to deliver improved health outcomes.\n*   **Data Security and Privacy Risks:** Protecting patient data is paramount, and risks related to data privacy and security are addressed through regulations like GDPR and the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. Technical security measures, such as those outlined in Cyber Essentials, are crucial for protecting digital health systems from cyber threats.\n*   **Strategic Risks:** ICSs are encouraged to develop risk management strategies that align with national priorities and address risks in rapidly changing environments, such as those involving new technologies or public health emergencies. This includes having agreed risk appetite statements and utilizing tools like risk assessment matrices.\n*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Mitigation strategies involve adhering to regulatory requirements, implementing robust governance and control processes, investing in necessary infrastructure and technology (including IT), and developing comprehensive risk management strategies. For digital health, this includes rigorous assessment through frameworks like DTAC and ensuring compliance with data protection and security standards. For infrastructure, addressing the disincentives of the PDC charge and exploring alternative funding models are potential mitigation strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, investments within the NHS, whether through PPPs, MIM, or other initiatives, are subject to complex economic considerations, regulatory requirements, and risk management processes. While schemes like public health interventions and certain MedTech adoptions demonstrate clear ROI, others, particularly large-scale infrastructure projects under models like PFI, have faced economic scrutiny. A robust regulatory framework, encompassing digital health compliance, infrastructure standards, and provider oversight, is in place to ensure safety and quality. Effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies, integrated across financial, clinical, and operational domains, are essential for navigating the challenges and maximizing the benefits of healthcare investments in the UK.", "tool_calls": null}]
