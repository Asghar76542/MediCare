Alternatively, investing in digital 3D and other imaging technology could bolster diagnostic tests, supporting the NHS to detect and treat cancer and other serious illnesses earlier.\\n\\nHealth and Social Care Secretary, Steve Barclay, said:\\n\\nIt is vital that clinicians have access to the latest technology to save staff time, deliver high quality care and help cut waiting lists - one of the government’s top 5 priorities.\\n\\nThis investment will see the latest tech innovations rolled out across the NHS. From virtual ward beds to wearable medical devices, patients will be better supported, and we will ease pressures on hospitals this winter.\\n\\nWe’re preparing for this winter earlier than ever before, including delivering thousands more hospital beds and hundreds of new ambulances.\\n\\nNHS interim National Director of Transformation, Dr Vin Diwakar, said:\\n\\nThe NHS’s world-leading ability to adopt new technology has already helped more than 210,000 patients be treated in their own homes through the rollout of virtual wards, and this new funding will allow the health service to adopt more innovations that improve patient care and reduce pressure on wider services.\\n\\nLocal NHS areas known as integrated care systems can now submit bids to the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England to access the funds so they can roll out the technology.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the government published its medical technology strategy, which set out steps to ensure patients can access safe, effective and innovative technology through the NHS.\\n\\nThis builds on the £21 million artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostics fund, which aims to improve access to the latest AI technology to diagnose and treat patients more quickly. NHS trusts were invited to bid for funding to accelerate the rollout of the most promising AI imaging and decision support tools to help diagnose patients more quickly for conditions such as cancer, stroke and heart conditions.\\n\\nThe new funding comes on top of a series of other measures the government is taking to support the NHS this winter. In September, an additional £200 million was invested in the health service to boost resilience and help patients get the care they need as quickly as possible in the coming months. The Urgent and Emergency Care Recovery Plan, announced in January, also committed to deliver 5,000 additional permanent, fully staffed hospital beds, 10,000 virtual ward beds and 800 new ambulances, backed by £1 billion.\\n\\nThe NHS Innovation Service is already helping the NHS find the best new innovations and provides innovators with the resources, tools and support they need to increase the chances of getting their product or idea adopted by the NHS.\\n\\nApplications are open and project delivery is expected this financial year, getting benefits to patients as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThe following links open in a new tab\\n\\n\\nThe press release has been updated as applications are now open for ICSs to bid for the funding.\\n\\nFirst published.\\n\\nDon’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.\\n\\nTo help us improve GOV.UK, we’d like to know more about your visit today.\\nPlease fill in this survey (opens in a new tab).\\n\\n\\n# Government to invest £30 million in innovative technology for NHS\\n\\n## Cookies on GOV.UK\\n\\n## Navigation menu\\n\\n## Notes to editors\\n\\n## Share this page\\n\\n## Updates to this page\\n\\n## Explore the topic\\n\\n## Is this page useful?\\n\\n## Services and information\\n\\n## Government activity\\n\\n## Support links\\n\\n### Services and information\\n\\n### Government activity\\n\\n### Search\\n\\n### Help us improve GOV.UK\\n\\n### Help us improve GOV.UK\\n\\nGovernment to invest £30 million in innovative technology for NHS - GOV.UKGOV.UK\\n----------------\\nEnd of this webpage.

ROI calculators have been developed for three of the innovations and these were available to the Fellows. A summary of the resource inputs, outcomes and findings for each innovation, are included in Table 4.1. The conclusions are based on current understanding and information/evidence returned in the analysis templates. Further detail on the assumptions made, sensitivity analysis performed and limitations of the analyses can be found in the case studies.\\n\\nTable 4.1: Summary of economic impact analysis for NIA innovations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsocietal benefits when the potential impacts on productivity are included.The preceding analysis shows that a number of innovations generate cost savings and a positive return on investment at organisational or CCG level (AliveCor Kardia Mobile, PneuX, NIC, Episcissors-60, health coaching, myCOPD). The exact scale of benefits across the country will depend on the number of times these innovations are used in practice. It has been easier to test the potential return on investment for innovations designed to achieve safety and efficiency as they have clear input costs and comparisons with usual care are possible. For Health Coaching, while implementation is widespread and diverse and it is not possible to quantify the total benefits from the roll out of this approach, the evidence indicates that the value of benefits has the potential to far exceed input costs. In the case of the Scarred Liver Pathway, a comprehensive economic analysis has shown this to be cost effective in that it achieves better health outcomes for a slightly higher cost than usual care.For some innovations there is evidence of potential to generate significant savings but it is not possible to establish the return on investment as the input costs of the innovations are not clear. This is either for reasons of commercial sensitivity, or because the costs have not yet been established (Sapientia, Patients Know Best, NeuroResponse). Conversely, for other innovations input costs are known and the expected benefits have been identified, but the benefits cannot be easily measured (Brush DJ, HealthUnlocked, Join Dementia Research, iThrive, Sleepio, OWise).Obtaining costs and outcome data presents a significant challenge in establishing innovation cost effectiveness for a number of reasons: costs cannot be identified, evaluations are being conducted but outcome data are not yet available, the implementation environment has high levels of local variation and other related initiatives in place making it difficult to track benefits in a standardised way (eg health coaching) or there is no mechanism for the collection of outcome data, so outcomes can be identified and valued but not measured. For example, it is difficult or impractical to measure app usage reliably for those which aim to reduce demand on healthcare by supporting people to self-manage. However, information available from user feedback and theoretical cost modelling suggests they have great potential to achieve reductions in healthcare demand and costs, while yielding improvements in health and wellbeing.\\n\\nDevelopment costs for the innovations are mostly not available as they are commercially sensitive or cannot be disaggregated within wider budgets. These were mostly incurred before the Fellow’s involvement in the NIA programme and, with the exception of Episcissors-60, are not incorporated in the economic analysis. From an NHS perspective, while the NHS is mostly not responsible for the development costs, it may be contributing indirectly if these have been built into the pricing strategy for the new technology.Some of the outcomes generated by the innovations are contributing to reduced demand on the health and social care system. These result from increased efficiency, achieving similar outcomes with fewer resources, reducing demand by improving health outcomes or avoiding preventable harm. There are also a number of innovations that bring societal benefits by contributing to improved productivity or preventing loss of productivity. Other outcomes generated by the innovations are increased patient and staff experience/satisfaction, promotion of safety culture and income from research funding.\\n\\nThe conservative estimates made suggest that some of the innovations could generate significant savings to the health and social care system. These are summarised in Table 4.2. The value of total benefits could be higher, because this calculation does not include benefits that cannot be easily quantified at this stage, or other benefits that have value, both to patients, the health and social care system and to society via increased productivity. Furthermore, there is the potential that benefits across the country are underestimated, as the full extent of scaling is not known. The value of the benefits from these innovations (based on data available and assumptions made) are thought to exceed the costs of the NIA programme in one year.\\n\\nTable 4.2: Summary of potential annual cost savings from NIA innovationsAs stated earlier, the results should be interpreted with caution, due to the limitations contained within the analyses in some cases.\\n\\nFactors that affect success in innovation scaling have been derived from systematic reviews of factors affecting innovation in healthcare contexts (Greenhalgh et al, 2004 and Dobbins, 2002) supplemented by additional items which emerged from examining the research data gathered for this evaluation.\\n\\nThey may relate to:\\n\\nThese factors are illustrated in Figure 5.1 .\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5.1: Conditions for success in innovation and potential impacts\\n\\nThe analysis is based on interview data gathered from Fellows, patients, stakeholders and core staff and on reviewing the initial and continuing applications completed by Fellows as part of the selection process to enrol on the NIA. The data has then been subjected to a process of qualitative comparative analysis, where individual factors and the contribution of each factor in enabling innovations to gain traction and overcoming blockages to scaling, is assessed.\\n\\nWhere the role of the NIA, characteristics of the Fellows and further factors appear to vary by type of innovation, these differences are drawn out.At a system level, the wider impact of the NIA has been to help tackle financial constraints and structural barriers to innovation diffusion, for example, through influencing development of the NHS Innovation and Technology Tariff. It also stimulated wider cultural change through conversations with NHS organisations and bringing groups such as AHSNs together to demonstrate models of collaborative working to diffuse healthcare innovations.\\n\\nThirteen Fellows from the first cohort attributed tangible progress in innovation take-up to NIA participation with one awaiting further evidence of impact. The NIA helped support the first cohort of 17 Fellows up to March 2017 to:\\n\\nwin at least 29 new contracts for the innovations create 45 full-time equivalent jobs ■ scale adoption of NIA innovations to at least 469 organisations secure over £28.4 million of additional investment develop over 114 new partnerships or collaborations with other organisations gain speaking opportunities at over 32 national and international events undertake 31 new research studies win 14 awards/high product ratings gain considerable publicity and coverage in national broadcast and print media.The conservative estimates made suggest that some of the innovations could generate significant savings to the health and social care system. The value of total benefits could be higher, because this calculation does not include benefits that cannot be easily quantified at this stage, or other benefits that have value, both to patients, the health and social care system and to society via increased productivity. Furthermore, there is the potential that benefits across the country are underestimated, as the full extent of scaling is not known. The value of the benefits from these innovations (based on data available and assumptions made) are thought to exceed the costs of the NIA programme in one year.\\n\\nThese results should be interpreted with caution however, due to the quality of the data available and the depth of analysis possible in some cases. Examples of the kinds of limitations in the analyses were as follows:\\n\\nuncertainty about innovation input costs;\\n\\nassumptions required about the attribution of impacts to the innovation;\\n\\nevidence from limited sources;\\n\\nrequirement to use evidence from overseas; and lack of quantifiable outcome data.The research identified a number of key factors which played an important role in contributing to innovation scaling. Overall, for each innovation, a mixture of success conditions was required which operated in a mutually reinforcing collaboration with a multiplicative effect. This means that the absence of any one of the factors was likely to halt or delay progress in innovation scaling.\\n\\nThe two most important conditions for success applicable to all innovations were support provided by the core NIA team, particularly in facilitating introductions to key people and access to national platforms, and patient involvement.\\n\\nAdditional features of the Fellows and their backgrounds which affected innovation scaling for one or more types of innovation included a range of personal characteristics. These included:\\n\\nentrepreneurial personality traits and drive: openness to new ideas and ways of working, high levels of intellectual ability and resilience to overcome setbacks excellent communication skills, tactful persuasion and ability to engage and maintain relationships with stakeholders, which was developed in some Fellows within the NIA experience\\n\\nusing clinical backgrounds to build rapport with clinicians\\n\\nknowledge of the NHS\\n\\naccess to wider resources or teams to promote their innovations.# 2 NIA Impact on Fellows ... 20# 3 NIA Impact on Innovation Scaling and Benefits....... 28# 4 Economic Assessment . 49# 5 Emerging Conditions for Success .. 58\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://ddm.health/post/cost-effectiveness-of-the-nhs-innovation-accelerator-economic-impact-evaluation-case-study-low-carb-program\",\n    \"query\": \"Low Carb Program ROI calculation details\",\n    \"content\": \"An independent health economic conducted by the York Health Economics Consortium has demonstrated a significant saving in implementation of the Low Carb Program in the NHS.\\n\\nThe Low Carb Program is adigital behaviour change platform for people with type 2 diabetes, providing goal-focused education, personalised resources and support to adopt a lower carbohydrate lifestyle.\\n\\nThe programme is provided through licences for participants paid for by CCGs, with primary care staff trained in the recruitment of participants and other aspects of the programme.  A trial has demonstrated benefits for participants in terms of weight loss, remission from type 2 diabetes, reduced HbA1c levels and elimination of medications.\\n\\nThe latter two metrics are used in this case study to estimate the net benefits and return on investment (ROI) of the Low Carb Program over a period of 5 years.\\n\\nFor a CCG with 3,000 licenses, it is assumed that the cost savings at the end of one year of Low Carb Program implementation would save an average of £117.57 per participant in de-medication.\\n\\nThe results estimate the net saving over 5 years to be between £673,108 and £509,435 for a CCG which contracts for 3,000 licences with a conservative 52% drop-out rate.

The platform was deployed to expand clinical capacity and equip carers and clinical teams with the tools needed to spot early deterioration in patients in the community.\\n\\nThe YHEC analysis evidenced substantial savings of £500,000 per 1,000 patients over a one-year period resulting from reductions in avoidable deterioration, A&E visits and hospital admissions. The evaluation was carried out using pre-implementation data, which included the number of NHS 111 calls, ambulance callouts and conveyances.\\n\\nThe project evidenced the potential of the technology to create clinical capacity by empowering both care providers and patients with the ability to identify and manage health concerns early, thereby reducing complications and the need for hospital admission.Unlike conventional remote monitoring tools, Feebris uses proprietary algorithms to ensure that anyone can capture clinically reliable information from diagnostic devices, reducing burden on clinicians.

But beyond the immediate savings our technology can generate for the system, this is also an opportunity to advance integrated care by appropriately incentivising community management of health in order to reduce pressures on our hospitals and urgent care centres. Our technology supports the NHS in managing health risks across the population and ensuring patients in need of clinical attention are appropriately prioritised.\\n\\n“We are extremely excited about the future as we continue to build on the success of this project, with more evaluations on the horizon in the coming months.

Your responses are completely anonymous.\\n\\nStart the survey.The UK has a proud record of innovation in healthcare and the deployment of innovations. Every day in the hospital and across the wider integrated care system in which I work, I see **how** **patients benefit from innovations designed by UK life sciences innovators, developed** **and trialled by NHS staff**, **and delivered for the first time in the world to UK patients**. The NHS pioneered procedures such as intra-ocular lens implants and total hip replacements and introduced novel technologies like CT and MRI scanning. Today exciting innovations are harnessing AI for faster image interpretation, and automation of laboratory and genomic testing to dramatically improve treatment choices. We should be in no doubt that our ecosystem has enabled earlier access to these innovations and transformed people’s lives.\\n\\nEvery day I also see **the very real economic benefits innovation brings**. I have the privilege of working in a world leading life sciences cluster, bringing employment and skills to the region and the UK – from apprenticeships to Nobel Prize winning academics – a community of energy and creativity that benefits the health of the nation and its economy.People from across the innovation ecosystem we have spoken to have **a clear sense that the UK can, and should, be the world’s innovation test bed**. Their confidence stems from our world leading academic institutions, globally respected regulators, amazing patient groups and third sector organisations, and a world leading life sciences sector with established firms and cutting-edge innovators. Where this has come together, we lead the world in emerging technologies like genomics and AI. Our healthcare staff are motivated to lead and drive this. We know that staff undertaking innovation and research are the most engaged and motivated in the NHS.\\n\\n**Innovation is more important than ever.** Our healthcare system is changing, and it must. It is estimated that by 2037 there will be 55% more people over 85 and as people age they require more care and more complex care. Furthermore, the proportion of our working age population is decreasing, putting pressure both on the NHS workforce and on public finances. Without embracing innovation, we put at risk having a sustainable healthcare system that meets the needs of our population. I see this in the eyes of the patients and staff on the challenging days in the hospital.Yet despite this urgent need to act, the staff, patients and wide range of partners we spoke to **sensed we were missing the opportunity to respond to the challenge**. Many said it took too long or was too difficult to try something new in a way that worked for them. Staff feel they do not have the capacity or the support to test, adopt and scale innovation, and even when they do, they have disjointed policy and regulation hurdles to clear, often within sceptical or risk averse cultures. Industry and academic partners often find it difficult to establish effective partnerships with NHS providers and integrated care boards. We heard that nationally, NHS England and government could do much more to provide clarity and consistency in their policy and priorities, and support to promote collaboration between the healthcare system and industry and academic partners.\\n\\n**If we do not address these issues patients will not get earlier access to innovations, and they may not get access at all.** We are starting to see companies planning not to launch medical devices in the UK. Some innovations arising from publicly funded research are benefitting patients in other markets but not here. If the UK has not supported the development and uptake of innovations, they can be priced at levels that do not deliver justifiable value.**The scale of the opportunity is huge and wide ranging:** for instance, automation to support the workforce, miniaturisation to allow people to receive more diagnostic tests and care out of hospital, and personalised biomarkers to improve outcomes and pick up disease earlier. The commitment of time and effort from industry members, academics, NHS staff and patients we have worked with during the review gives me confidence that we can make real progress in short order.\\n\\nMost importantly, I want to emphasise that **realising the opportunities will require a greater scale of ambition, with the funding, long-term planning and support to match**. Many of the recommendations in this report will not feel new; they will be familiar from past discussions and reports on the topic. What is different here is the consistent, co-ordinated, long-term approach to fixing what is holding us back, and fixing it collaboratively. Delivering the recommendations set out here will take time, and we must therefore focus immediate action on our key priorities – agreeing our core national priorities, enhancing and simplifying our innovation oversight, mobilising our core clusters behind this work and engaging with the innovation leaders of the future.I am grateful to Amanda Pritchard, Chief Executive of NHS England, for commissioning me to undertake this work, and to those at NHS England and other bodies who have supported me to do so. I am particularly grateful to the members of the Advisory Group, listed below, who have co-led the work with me and to the many others who have given their time generously in interviews, roundtables and developing and testing the recommendations. All have maintained the balance of co-creation and robustly represented their specific stakeholder views. This must continue as we take forward the next stage of work.\\n\\n**Roland Sinker CBE**, Chief Executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Cambridge Biomedical Campus, and National Director for Life Sciences, NHS England.This report summarises the Innovation Ecosystem Programme’s (IEP) findings from the last 18 months and recommends a package of actions to move forward. This work could have been completed quickly but it is the working steadily together that will deliver change. It is a summary of our learning and presents a clear path towards building an ecosystem that can help transform health and care in the UK and support the growth of our economy. We hope it will be an important contribution to the forthcoming 10-Year Health Plan, the Innovation and Adoption Strategy and the Life Sciences Sector Plan.\\n\\nThe recommendations set out in this document are a complex package of work, that if delivered in full will make a significant difference in supporting the testing and adoption of innovation in the UK. But it is this collaborative way of working together that matters as much as the recommendations itself.We have referred to our work as the Innovation Ecosystem Programme. Throughout our focus has been ‘innovation’ and in particular the real-world testing and development, adoption and scaling of new clinical interventions coming out of the life sciences industry. Given the positive work happening, we have not directly addressed any recommendations to areas of quality improvement or the clinical research system. However, collectively we will need to align all these activities. Often it is the same people leading across a range of activities and functions. This alignment can deliver for patients and for economic growth.\\n\\nThe NHS is at a critical juncture, facing both significant challenges and tremendous opportunities through innovation.\\n\\nOn the one hand, it is grappling with workforce capacity, inefficiencies and widening health inequalities that have a substantial impact on individuals and the nation’s health. These challenges are exacerbated by rising demand for care, an ageing population and stretched resources.On the other hand, the NHS and its partners – in the patient and charity sector, regulation, industry and universities – have an incredible record of developing life-saving treatments and innovative technologies and setting benchmarks for high quality patient care. They give the UK an unparalleled potential to be the world leader in the testing and adoption of healthcare innovation. The NHS’s scale, deep integration with the UK’s thriving life sciences sector and access to rich health data puts it in a unique position to drive advances in medical technologies. This will deliver transformative patient outcomes and economic impact for the UK. However, to seize the opportunities that come through innovation, NHS England and its partners must be decisive. We need to galvanise action at all levels – national, regional, integrated care system (ICS) and neighbourhood – to overcome the challenges the NHS faces today. Our aim is to unlock the NHS’s full potential to improve patient outcomes through innovation and enhance the nation’s health and economy for the future.The Chief Executive of NHS England commissioned the IEP with a mandate to foster collaboration between the NHS and key stakeholders, industry, academia and regulatory bodies. Our objective was to streamline the development and adoption of healthcare innovations by making recommendations but also defining a collaborative way of working – solving problems together as well as agreeing and delivering plans for the future.\\n\\nOur recommendations stem from analysis of extensive engagement – hundreds of interviews, roundtables and working group discussions – through 4 targeted workstreams led by the chief executives and chairs of many of the key organisations in the life sciences ecosystem.\\n\\nThroughout the programme a clear set of 5 emerging findings have consistently emerged from our discussions, roundtables and analysis of the current ecosystem.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.iqvia.com/locations/united-kingdom/blogs/2024/09/accelerating-innovation-across-the-healthcare-system\",\n    \"query\": \"strategies for life sciences and HealthTech companies to leverage NHS innovation ecosystem\",\n    \"content\": \"Failed to get the website\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The Feebris case study showed £500,000 annual savings per 1,000 patients, with potential £200m UK-wide savings, demonstrating strong ROI.\n\nThe england.nhs.uk article on Innovation Ecosystem Programme (IEP) highlighted strategic advantages:\n* UK's strength in AI and genomics\n* NHS England's role in fostering collaboration\n* Recommendations for streamlining innovation adoption\n* Realizing opportunities requires ambition, funding, planning, and support\n\nThe iqvia.com link failed.\n\nI still need:\n1.

The NHS spends £10 billion a year on medtech including syringes, wheelchairs, cardiac pacemakers and medical imaging equipment such as X-ray machines.\\n\\nBuilding on learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid development of medical technologies during that time such as lateral flow tests and ventilators, this strategy will ensure the right product is available at the right price and in the right place. As a result, patients will continue to have access to high-quality care, alongside improved patient safety and health outcomes.\\n\\nThe strategy aims to deliver value for money, using the latest data on the effectiveness of new technology to ensure prices are reasonable for the health system. It will also help build resilient supply chains and ensure the UK is prepared for future pandemics, just as demand for technology like syringes and ventilators rapidly increase during the pandemic.Using medtech effectively will be critical in reducing waiting lists for treatment caused by the pandemic as it has the potential to speed up diagnosis and deliver new and improved ways to treat and support patients. For example, COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of fast and accurate diagnostic testing and genome sequencing to process and share results, and home lateral flow testing showed the potential for increased use of diagnostics outside of formal clinical settings, to support earlier diagnosis and free up staff time.\\n\\nMinister of State for Health Will Quince said:\\n\\nThe UK’s innovative spirit delivered revolutionary technology during the pandemic - from COVID tests and ventilators - and we want to harness this in promoting cutting-edge medical advancements to improve patient care.\\n\\nThe NHS spends around £10 billion a year on medical technology and I’m looking forward to working with industry to use this as we focus on reducing hospital stays, enhancing diagnosis, preventing illness and freeing up staff time.\\n\\nThis new medtech strategy will help build a sustainable NHS with patients at the centre so people can continue to access the right care at the right time.\\n\\nThe key aims of the strategy are to:The implementation plan to deliver on this strategy will be published later this year and will include a review of the £1 billion spent on appliances in primary care, new comparison tools to enable better decision making when purchasing which achieve the best results for patients, and collaboration with industry to ensure availability of key products to keep patients safe.\\n\\nDr Timothy Ferris, National Director for Transformation at NHS England said:\\n\\nMedical technology has an enormous role to play in benefitting patients now and in the future.\\n\\nThe importance of medtech was made clear during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the NHS moves through its recovery, it will play a key role in addressing the challenges we face.\\n\\nDr Sam Roberts of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said:\\n\\nIt is essential that clinicians and patients can access the most impactful and cost-effective medical technologies, while medtech companies need to be confident that they are developing products which meet the needs of patients and the NHS.\\n\\nThis strategy sets out a clear vision for the future. NICE is excited to be part of the delivery of this vision, working with our partners to further develop world leading processes to provide a sustainable pathway for medical technologies, from innovation to implementation.Peter Ellingworth of the Association of British HealthTech Industries said:\\n\\nABHI welcomes the publication of the DHSC medtech strategy, and the recognition it brings to the importance of HealthTech in supporting the NHS to deliver exceptional care for people in the UK. HealthTech plays a valuable role in enabling improved outcomes through changing patient pathways as well as productivity and efficiency gains.\\n\\nIt is important that this strategy supports the ambition of the Life Sciences Vision to create an outstanding business environment for HealthTech companies. We look forward to working closely with the Directorate in the implementation the strategy.\\n\\nThis strategy follows action to cut NHS waiting times as one of the government’s top 5 priorities, backed by up to £14.1 billion of health and social care funding available for the next 2 years, on top of record funding and the publishing of a new urgent and emergency care recovery plan.\\n\\nThe following links open in a new tab\\n\\n\\nDon’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.\\n\\nTo help us improve GOV.UK, we’d like to know more about your visit today.\\nPlease fill in this survey (opens in a new tab).# New strategy to boost NHS access to innovative medical technology\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5158272/\",\n    \"query\": \"recommendations for healthcare technology companies to engage with NHS innovation programs and AHSNs\",\n    \"content\": \"An official website of the United States government\\n\\n\\n**Official websites use .gov**\\n\\nA\\n**.gov** website belongs to an official\\ngovernment organization in the United States.\\n\\n\\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**\\n\\nA **lock** (\\nLock\\nLocked padlock icon\\n) or **https://** means you've safely\\nconnected to the .gov website.

Through a focused engagement exercise with key healthcare stakeholders this project explored the implications of selected interim AAR propositions and feasibility of implementation for key actors, in primary and secondary care as well as commissioners and academia. Specifically, the project investigated the feasibility of implementation of three specific propositions including: a new earmarked fund to encourage AHSNs and other key innovation actors to re-design systems to embrace innovation; mobilising the influence of clinical system leaders to champion change; and encouraging secondary care organisations to take on “innovation champion” roles linked to financial incentives and a new emphasis on accountable care organisations. Data was collected on the feasibility of the three AAR propositions from a workshop with AHSN CEOs and Commercial Directors and interviews with senior NHS staff in three AHSN regions (South West, University College London Partners, and North East, North Cumbria). The study concludes with reflections on the feasibility of each recommendation and identifiesfactors expected to facilitate or challenge their implementation, as well as considering the wider cross cutting issues that may influence the adoption and diffusion of innovation in the NHS.The Department of Health and the Wellcome Trust, in cooperation with NHS England, asked RAND Europe to conduct a focused engagement with key stakeholders, about the practicality of measures and incentives proposed as part of the Accelerated Access Review (AAR). The work was conducted in December 2015 and January 2016.\\n\\nThe AAR interim report suggests a number of propositions that have the potential to accelerate access to high-impact innovations, with specific roles outlined for Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) and secondary care organisations (spanning specialist hospitals, teaching hospitals, district general hospitals and other secondary care providers).\\n\\nThis work explores the implications of a subset of propositions outlined in the interim AAR report relating to Proposition Four: Galvanising the NHS. Specifically, the project investigates the feasibility of implementation by AHSNs and the role of secondary care organisations for three specific propositions:\\n\\nA new earmarked fund to encourage AHSNs and other key innovation actors to lead system redesign to embrace innovation and the adoption of evidence-based, high-impact innovations.\\n\\nMobilising the influence of clinical system leaders to champion change.Encouraging secondary care organisations to take on “innovation champion” roles linked to financial incentives and a new emphasis on accountable careorganisations (ACO).\\n\\nThis study provides a high-level summary of views from a range of stakeholders, including AHSNs, teaching hospitals, primary care organisations, commissioners and academia on the feasibility of these recommendations, and the associated critical factors that are important for enabling implementation.\\n\\nOur approach involved a targeted set of discussions, using interviews and workshops, with representatives of key stakeholder groups across the healthcare pathway on the AAR interim report. The engagement was used to explore the implications of selected AAR propositions and feasibility of implementation for AHSNs and other key actors, such as specialist and teaching hospitals, district general hospitals, primary care organisations, commissioners and academia. Data collection included:\\n\\nA document review to highlight challenges for innovation adoption and diffusion in the NHS related to the recommendations and help to focus and refine the design of data collection activities.\\n\\nA workshop with AHSN CEOs/Commercial Directors (December 2015) to explore the implications of the propositions in the interim AAR report with senior AHSN leadership.23 interviews with senior NHS staff in three AHSN regions (South West, UCL Partners\\\\ [1\\\\], and North East, North Cumbria), to provide coverage of perceptions on the AAR propositions across different regions and explore how the roles assigned to NHS providers in the interim review are understood and viewed by the stakeholders. Interviews included representatives from across the NHS organisations, including senior executives of hospital trusts, and senior representatives of CCGs, CLAHRCs (Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care), GPs, social care, senior clinicians and academics from medical schools. We are confident that the diversity of individuals within an AHSN region has led to a multifaceted account of key issues to consider.\\n\\nThus the work provides a perceptions audit of stakeholder responses to the propositions highlighted above. References to “participants” are used to indicate agreement in responses from both interviewees and those attending the AHSN workshop.\\n\\nThe aim of this recommendation would be to encourage AHSNs and other key innovation actors (such as secondary care organisations, vanguards of new models of care or test beds) to lead system redesign and embrace the adoption of evidence-based, high impact innovations.Proposed funding for system redesign to support innovation adoption was generally well received, with funding identified as an important incentive for changing behaviour, system redesign and reorganisation of processes. The overall view was that provision of earmarked innovation funding would encourage and concentrate collaboration of different health and social care actors to work on innovation adoption. The majority of participants felt this type of funding would:\\n\\nHelp promote local initiatives to bring together the necessary actors to help support the adoption of innovations, and their wider diffusion.\\n\\nSupport take-up of projects that are currently challenged by budget silos.\\n\\nProvide “headroom” for innovation and risk-taking. This is particularly important in regions with budget deficits, where only limited resources can be dedicated towards innovation because the risk of innovation projects failing to deliver anticipated efficiencies has real implications for the budgeted spending on frontline services.\\\\ [2\\\\]A small number of participants felt the funding might be better allocated to support those working in frontline service delivery, with some concerns that an additional earmarked fund would risk supporting too many innovation projects. This also relates to a concern raised in several interviews and at the AHSN workshop, that any fund would require appropriate fund management and coordination mechanisms to identify appropriate opportunities for investment. In particular, these participants highlighted that funding must be used to deliver innovation through the full healthcare pathway to increase the likelihood of innovation being widely adopted and diffused once the initial funding had been spent.\\n\\nA high proportion of interview and workshop participants felt the recommendation had promise but thought a key enabler of the fund would be to put in place a clear, open and transparent _governance_ process, to demonstrate how the fund would be managed, in terms of: identifying investment priorities, making use of evidence for a clear decisionmaking process, monitoring investments and demonstrating the impact of funding for patients and/or cost efficiencies.\\\\ [3\\\\] This will also help to build the evidence base on “what works.” A key element of the governance of the fund, as identified at the AHSN workshop, would be to have clearly identified purpose to help rationalise decisionmaking.\\\\ [4\\\\]The nature of the _financial model_ adopted for the operation of the fund was another critical success factor viewed as important by participants. Closely related to governance issues, proposed financial models included that the fund could be run as a competitive challenge grant, or that savings generated from successfully funded innovations might be reused in the local economy.\\\\ [5\\\\] Other issues raised included the need for a potential fund to operate over multiple budget periods to provide consistency, stability, reduce search costs\\\\ [6\\\\] and improve budgeting efficiency.\\n\\nThe extent of _competition_ for funding was also viewed as an important critical success factor, although a range of perspectives were provided. Some participants felt funding should be ring-fenced at a local level to ensure all regions had a dedicated pot of funding to support innovation adoption and diffusion activities. In contrast, a small number of interviewees felt the fund should be fully competitive and hosted at a national level. To enable the fund to work successfully, a clear remit and objectives would be required to clarify the purpose, i.e. whether to encourage a wide distribution of funds to support the adoption of local innovation across England or to fund the most promising investment opportunities on a national level.\\\\ [7\\\\]\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Starting to generate the final answer. Please wait a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Executive Investment Summary for MediCare Innovation\n\nThis summary provides an overview of NHS UK government funding schemes and investment opportunities relevant to MediCare Innovation, highlighting key financial metrics, potential return on investment (ROI), and strategic advantages. It concludes with executive-level recommendations for pursuing these funding avenues.\n\nThe UK healthcare sector, particularly the NHS, presents significant opportunities for innovation, driven by the need to address challenges such as an ageing population, increasing demand, and resource constraints. The government has demonstrated a commitment to investing in innovative medical technology (medtech) to improve patient care, enhance efficiency, and support economic growth.\n\n### NHS UK Government Funding Schemes and Investment Opportunities\n\nSeveral initiatives and funding streams are available to accelerate the adoption and scaling of healthcare innovations within the NHS:\n\n*   **NHS Innovation Service:** This free online platform acts as a gateway for health innovators, connecting them with relevant organizations that can provide tailored support, including guidance from Health Innovation Networks, NICE, MHRA, NIHR, and NHS Supply Chain. It also provides information on funding opportunities, awards, and competitions.\n*   **Health Innovation Networks (formerly Academic Health Science Networks - AHSNs):** These networks operate across England, embedded in local health and research ecosystems. They partner with healthcare networks and businesses to support the spread of innovation within the NHS. Their support includes guidance on value propositions, evidence base development, proof-of-concept prototyping, navigating the health and care sector, developing value propositions for market readiness, impact modelling, health economics, and brokering connections with experts. They also support real-world evaluations, roll-out, and adoption.\n*   **SBRI Healthcare (Small Business Research Initiative):** This program releases regular funding competitions in partnership with organizations like the Health Innovation Network. SBRI Healthcare awards aim to help the NHS develop new technologies and solutions for significant healthcare challenges. Recent examples include funding for work-related digital innovations for individuals with poor mental health and innovations supporting women's health.\n*   **NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA):** An NHS England initiative delivered in partnership with Health Innovation Networks, the NIA accelerates the uptake of high-impact innovations for the benefit of patients, the population, and NHS staff. It provides real-time insights on spread to inform national strategy. The NIA invites applications from exceptional individuals representing innovations that meet a real need through an annual international call. Successful applicants receive bespoke support, including mentorship, links with Health Innovation Networks and other stakeholders, peer-to-peer learning, a dedicated learning program, and a bursary. Since 2015, the NIA has supported over 100 Fellows to scale solutions across the health and care system.\n*   **Government Investment in Innovative Technology:** The UK government has made targeted investments to accelerate the adoption of innovative technology. For example, in October 2023, £30 million was allocated for Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) to roll out innovative technology, including virtual wards and wearable devices, to help cut waiting lists and improve care. This builds on previous initiatives like the £21 million Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostics fund.\n\n### Key Financial Metrics and ROI Potential\n\nWhile specific financial metrics and ROI vary depending on the innovation and the scale of adoption, the provided information highlights the potential for significant returns:\n\n*   **Cost Savings:** Innovations supported by the NHS Innovation Accelerator have demonstrated the potential to generate significant savings for the health and social care system. Examples include:\n    *   The Low Carb Program, a digital platform for type 2 diabetes, demonstrated potential net savings over 5 years ranging from £509,435 to £673,108 for a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with 3,000 licenses, resulting in an ROI of between 2.38.\n    *   The Feebris AI-guided virtual care platform demonstrated substantial savings of £500,000 per 1,000 patients over one year in North-East London, primarily from reductions in avoidable deterioration, A&E visits, and hospital admissions. If scaled across all care home residents in the UK, Feebris could potentially generate over £200 million in savings per year.\n*   **Increased Efficiency and Productivity:** Many innovations aim to improve efficiency, achieve similar outcomes with fewer resources, and reduce demand on the health and social care system. This can lead to cost savings and increased productivity.\n*   **Attracting Further Investment:** Participation in programs like the NIA can help innovators secure additional investment. The first cohort of NIA Fellows secured over £28.4 million in additional investment.\n\nIt is important to note that while many innovations show potential for cost savings, quantifying the exact return on investment can be challenging due to factors such as uncertainty about input costs, the need for assumptions about the attribution of impacts, and variations in implementation environments. However, the evidence suggests that the value of benefits from successful innovations can exceed the costs of the programs supporting them.\n\n### Strategic Advantages for MediCare Innovation\n\nPursuing NHS UK government funding schemes offers several strategic advantages for MediCare Innovation:\n\n*   **Accelerated Adoption and Scaling:** Programs like the NIA and support from Health Innovation Networks are specifically designed to accelerate the uptake and spread of high-impact innovations across the NHS.\n*   **Access to Expertise and Networks:** These initiatives provide access to a wide range of experts, including clinicians, patients, commercial assessors, mentors, and key stakeholders within the NHS and wider healthcare ecosystem. This facilitates valuable connections and insights.\n*   **Validation and Evidence Generation:** Working with the NHS provides a globally respected ecosystem for conducting research and generating real-world evidence of the innovation's value and impact. This is crucial for wider adoption and market access.\n*   **Alignment with National Priorities:** Engaging with NHS funding schemes ensures that MediCare Innovation's solutions are aligned with the strategic priorities of the NHS and the government, increasing the likelihood of successful implementation and scaling.\n*   **Enhanced Credibility and Visibility:** Being part of NHS-backed programs and initiatives enhances the credibility and visibility of MediCare Innovation within the UK healthcare market and internationally.\n\n### Executive-Level Recommendations\n\nBased on the analysis of NHS UK government funding schemes and investment opportunities, the following recommendations are proposed for MediCare Innovation:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Engagement with the NHS Innovation Service:** Utilize the NHS Innovation Service as a primary resource to identify relevant funding opportunities, awards, and competitions, and to connect with support organizations.\n2.  **Actively Engage with Health Innovation Networks:** Establish strong relationships with the relevant Health Innovation Networks in target regions to leverage their expertise, local connections, and support for navigating the NHS landscape and facilitating adoption.\n3.  **Evaluate SBRI Healthcare Competitions:** Regularly monitor and evaluate SBRI Healthcare funding competitions for alignment with MediCare Innovation's technology and development stage, particularly those addressing key NHS challenges.\n4.  **Consider Application to the NHS Innovation Accelerator:** Assess the eligibility criteria and application process for the NHS Innovation Accelerator's annual call. Successful application could provide significant acceleration and support for scaling high-impact innovations.\n5.  **Develop Robust Economic Case Studies:** For innovations demonstrating potential cost savings or efficiency gains, invest in developing robust economic case studies and ROI calculations to clearly articulate the value proposition to NHS commissioners and decision-makers.\n6.  **Align Innovation Development with NHS Priorities:** Ensure that future innovation development is closely aligned with the stated priorities of the NHS and the government's medtech strategy to maximize the potential for adoption and funding.\n\nBy strategically engaging with these NHS UK government funding schemes and leveraging the support structures available, MediCare Innovation can significantly accelerate the adoption and scaling of its innovations, contributing to improved patient care and realizing substantial returns within the UK healthcare system.", "tool_calls": null}]
