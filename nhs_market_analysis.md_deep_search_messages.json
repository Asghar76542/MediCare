I am particularly grateful to the members of the Advisory Group, listed below, who have co-led the work with me and to the many others who have given their time generously in interviews, roundtables and developing and testing the recommendations. All have maintained the balance of co-creation and robustly represented their specific stakeholder views. This must continue as we take forward the next stage of work.\\n\\n**Roland Sinker CBE**, Chief Executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Cambridge Biomedical Campus, and National Director for Life Sciences, NHS England.This report summarises the Innovation Ecosystem Programme’s (IEP) findings from the last 18 months and recommends a package of actions to move forward. This work could have been completed quickly but it is the working steadily together that will deliver change. It is a summary of our learning and presents a clear path towards building an ecosystem that can help transform health and care in the UK and support the growth of our economy. We hope it will be an important contribution to the forthcoming 10-Year Health Plan, the Innovation and Adoption Strategy and the Life Sciences Sector Plan.\\n\\nThe recommendations set out in this document are a complex package of work, that if delivered in full will make a significant difference in supporting the testing and adoption of innovation in the UK. But it is this collaborative way of working together that matters as much as the recommendations itself.We have referred to our work as the Innovation Ecosystem Programme. Throughout our focus has been ‘innovation’ and in particular the real-world testing and development, adoption and scaling of new clinical interventions coming out of the life sciences industry. Given the positive work happening, we have not directly addressed any recommendations to areas of quality improvement or the clinical research system. However, collectively we will need to align all these activities. Often it is the same people leading across a range of activities and functions. This alignment can deliver for patients and for economic growth.\\n\\nThe NHS is at a critical juncture, facing both significant challenges and tremendous opportunities through innovation.\\n\\nOn the one hand, it is grappling with workforce capacity, inefficiencies and widening health inequalities that have a substantial impact on individuals and the nation’s health. These challenges are exacerbated by rising demand for care, an ageing population and stretched resources.On the other hand, the NHS and its partners – in the patient and charity sector, regulation, industry and universities – have an incredible record of developing life-saving treatments and innovative technologies and setting benchmarks for high quality patient care. They give the UK an unparalleled potential to be the world leader in the testing and adoption of healthcare innovation. The NHS’s scale, deep integration with the UK’s thriving life sciences sector and access to rich health data puts it in a unique position to drive advances in medical technologies. This will deliver transformative patient outcomes and economic impact for the UK. However, to seize the opportunities that come through innovation, NHS England and its partners must be decisive. We need to galvanise action at all levels – national, regional, integrated care system (ICS) and neighbourhood – to overcome the challenges the NHS faces today. Our aim is to unlock the NHS’s full potential to improve patient outcomes through innovation and enhance the nation’s health and economy for the future.The Chief Executive of NHS England commissioned the IEP with a mandate to foster collaboration between the NHS and key stakeholders, industry, academia and regulatory bodies. Our objective was to streamline the development and adoption of healthcare innovations by making recommendations but also defining a collaborative way of working – solving problems together as well as agreeing and delivering plans for the future.\\n\\nOur recommendations stem from analysis of extensive engagement – hundreds of interviews, roundtables and working group discussions – through 4 targeted workstreams led by the chief executives and chairs of many of the key organisations in the life sciences ecosystem.\\n\\nThroughout the programme a clear set of 5 emerging findings have consistently emerged from our discussions, roundtables and analysis of the current ecosystem.**There is a solid foundation to build on, but we must expand and translate what we do well.** The NHS has many strengths in innovation, in early-stage research and development, real world testing and initial site adoption, and in some cases, such as cancer and genomics, the delivery of flagship national innovation programmes. We already have the ingredients to enable transformation and there is no shortage of innovations being explored in the NHS, as well as in partnership with industry. We also found that stakeholders have a clear, common understanding of what it takes to successfully adopt innovations. We can and must build on the pockets of excellence that already apply this understanding to scale current innovation. But we also need to go further by looking to the future and understanding how emerging technologies give us the tools for a faster shift to prevention, early diagnosis and out of hospital care. New skills and experience in new settings will be required.**We must focus on the biggest priorities.** The scale of the challenge to transform our services should not be underestimated, and we will need to make choices about where our scarce resources are directed. The NHS and its partners will need to be less ‘supply side’ in how they identify innovation, instead prioritising innovation and research support for areas of greatest need, aligned to the government’s health and economic growth missions. We will need to move away from the historical focus on individual products to categories of innovation and shifts in care, and from looking at a 1 to 2-year horizon for innovation and research to planning for 3, 5 and 10 years ahead.\\n\\n**The NHS cannot do this alone or from the top down.** We need better alignment of innovation and research infrastructure – orientated towards the local and with easier gateways for partners to engage with the NHS. We need clarity on who is responsible for what and when to enable simplified, streamlined access for both testing new things and rolling out. And this infrastructure should be aligned to national ambitions and be supported by national levers. However, national implementation policy should not be so prescriptive that it stifles the mobilisation of collaborative local systems.**Success will come down to getting the culture right, building a skilled workforce and putting the right enablers in place.** Innovation only succeeds when it can be effectively adopted locally, and this needs individuals who can drive through implementation in a supportive culture. For the right culture, patient and citizen voice, NHS management and clinical leadership, and strong industry support will be key in sending the signal that innovation and research are important. For effective leadership, enablers will need to be in place to better empower NHS staff on the ground to participate in research and adopt innovation: data, procurement processes, and the time and incentives. We also need to make it easier to adopt innovation by reducing friction in the system with a clear, consistent, standardised and streamlined rules-based approach, and standardise how industry, academia, charities and patients can partner with the NHS.**This will take time, and we will need to be consistent and long term in our approach.** The NHS has suffered from a series of short-term projects and approaches (despite the same barriers and enablers being identified over the last 20 years). Success in implementing the recommendations of the IEP will require collective accountability and resourcing for 3 to 10 years, with a clear strategy that all partners are signed up to and eager to support.\\n\\nOur recommendations (summarised below under 4 areas) focus on what the NHS and its partners are already well placed to do to evolve the ecosystem towards meeting the needs of the future through the testing, adoption and scaling of innovation for the benefit of patients and staff. They represent a complex, ambitious programme of work. We are aware that some are already being addressed; others will need further development and agreement before implementation.\\n\\nThere is no single action that can unlock innovation and no individual partner that can deliver change on their own. Instead, we recommend a package of reforms that are designed to work synergistically. Behind the words there will be significant trade-offs and complex policy to introduce, as well as funding changes that require the support of all partners.The key message from the IEP to all partners is to collaborate, prioritise and align to better meet the needs of patients and the public.\\n\\n**1\\\\. Make innovation core to NHS business**: Integrate innovation with NHS priorities alongside education and research and do so in a way that also works for the wider ecosystem.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Prioritise and co-ordinate innovation around the shifts and goals for health**: Focus on healthcare shifts such as digitalisation, prevention and home care, with priorities harmonised across NHS plans. This will require choices to be made on specific shifts rather than attempting to do everything.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Establish co-ordinated oversight and aligned innovation funding**: Consolidate funding and oversight to support the innovation priorities with clearer accountability.\\n\\n**4\\\\. Develop incentives to support and monitor delivery**: Use key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and incentivise innovation adoption within NHS governance and oversight.\\n\\n**5\\\\.

ICSs, which have existed in ‘shadow’ form for multiple years, finally gained statutory footing in April 2022 and have been allocated clear protocols and guidelines for planning and funding healthcare services in their respective governing regions.\\n\\nBroadly, the overarching aims of ICSs can be boiled down to four primary purposes that have been established to tackle interregional population inequalities such as housing, financial stress and poverty. These are:\\n\\nDue to the diverse social and financial discrepancies between regions, it is seemingly impossible to ascribe an overarching inclusive system conducive to each locality’s nuanced needs. To address this, ICSs possess heightened agency and flexibility to work within their respective region.\\n\\nThe UK government has taken a sort of feudal approach towards the ICSs, with each system possessing varying funding abilities depending on the size and demands of its constituents.\\n\\nHowever, due to the stark differences between some of the ICS regions, issues surrounding funding and capital allocation arise as, for effective national healthcare, ICSs must meet the needs of all covered sectors and not a specific few.\\n\\nICSs are currently being developed at different starting points and at varying paces. When we consider that each ICS is responsible for planning and funding health and care services within their respective region, problems such as healthcare inequality arise.\\n\\nHence, capital allocation must be approached dynamically and integrate innovators’ ability to effectively contribute to its relevant locality. To support this, NHS England and NHS Improvement have decided to allocate increasing degrees of financial responsibility to ICSs and ensure that they receive the following:\\n\\nDespite these advances, the field remains fragmented, adding an extra layer of complexity for innovators to navigate. However, this does not negate the government’s intention to provide a seamless pathway for healthcare providers to adopt new technologies developed by innovators.\\n\\nThis is outlined within the NHS Long Term Plan, which seeks to inform innovators about the different sectors of the NHS and their investments moving forward. Paired with the current reforms happening within the ICSs, innovators will be able to have their projects efficiently processed and communicated between the different localities, ensuring their reach and relevancy.\\n\\nAdditionally, due to the increased coordination, ICSs will grant the ability to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the availability that a commissioned product will have on its constituents. Due to the increased coordination, a broader population data sample is available to innovators.\\n\\nThe ICS framework presents itself as a unique opportunity for the technological products of innovators to reach expansive populations within a given locality. In that regard, there is a dual incentive for ICS to adopt digital technology to enhance patient outcomes and an industrial incentive to push new technologies into practice.\\n\\nAs an innovator, you can rest assured that ICS advances are placing an innovation pipeline as a top priority for achieving their overarching purpose of delivering optimal and equal care for local populations. While the main priority of ICSs is to give a patient voice at the table, the innovator’s voice is given equal valence in how ICSs seek to undertake their delivery of health and social care services.\\n\\nAre they ready to do this, you may ask? Certainly, the national health and care systems are going through significant operational pressures following the advent of the Pandemic. However, there is a simultaneous push towards remedying the pressures caused by these events and established long-term plans to achieve this.\\n\\nMore specifically, technological innovation will be a fundamental cornerstone of national healthcare reform and new pathways are being established in order to maximise the impact they will have on the individuals in need, which in the end, are those who matter the most.\\n\\nWith a keen on eye innovation and a focus on enabling new technologies within the UK healthcare sector, HIC have a wealth of experience in delivering digital capabilities referenced across many ICS digital strategies.

The analysis looks at how current funding compares with historical levels and how it stacks up against what is needed to meet future pressures.\\n\\nThis page was originally published on 20 March 2023 and is updated at every fiscal event. This analysis is based on the March 2025 economic forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility and Treasury figures on spending plans from March 2025.\\n\\nAll growth rates are presented in real terms (2024/25 prices) after adjusting for changes in pensions policy (see Note).\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Social Care’s (DHSC’s) total budget, which consists of revenue and capital components, sets the limit on overall health funding in England. Around 90% of DHSC revenue funding goes to NHS England to pay for the day-to-day running costs of the NHS, including for staff pay and medicines. The remaining DHSC revenue funding covers a range of programmes, including health care staff education and training and local government public health services. Capital funding is used to finance long-term investments, such as buildings and medical equipment.The 2025 Spring Statement updated the planned health care spend for 2024/25 and 2025/26 following the most recent Supplementary estimates (the mechanism by which government departments request additional in-year funding from parliament).\\n\\nTable 1 and Figure 1 show the spend for DHSC and NHS England by funding type (revenue, capital and total) from 2023/24 to 2025/26 in nominal figures (cash) and real figures (adjusted for inflation).\\n\\n2.8%\\n\\n2.6%\\n\\n10.0%\\n\\n**3.2%**\\n\\n\\\\\\\\* See Note box\\n\\n\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\* Calculated as the compound annual growth rate\\n\\nThe sum of DHSC revenue and capital might not exactly equal DHSC total due to rounding.Between 2023/24 and 2025/26, the total budget for health will see a real-terms increase of 3.2% per year. Planned revenue and capital spend will rise by 2.8% and 10.0% per year, respectively. Within planned spend, NHS England’s revenue spend will rise by 2.6% per year.\\n\\nSource: HMT Spring Statement 2025 and Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (various releases) • Real terms values are in 2024/25 prices, using the GDP deflator series from HM Treasury (March 2025).\\n\\nWe present spending figures in cash terms and real terms, using our own calculations to account for inflation. We use the GDP deflator as the standard measure of inflation. This is the deflator used by the Treasury to calculate buying power across all public services.We also remove changes to pensions policy when we present our total budget and revenue budget so our measures are comparable over the long term. These policy changes reflect an increase in the employer contribution rate to 6.3% from April 2019 (costing an estimated £2.85bn) and a further 3.1% (£1.97bn) rise from April 2024. This was separately reflected in the financial directions to NHS England in March 2024 and represents a one-off adjustment to staff pensions. This should be treated more like an accounting adjustment rather than a meaningful addition to total health spend. We choose not to include these costs to avoid distorting comparisons of health spend over time.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the real-terms growth rates in total health funding over the past 40 years under different governments. The planned increase in funding between 2023/24 and 2025/26 (3.2%) is below the pre-COVID-19 long-term average (3.7%). However, it is higher than the funding growth observed in the decade preceding the pandemic (1.6% per year).Figure 3 illustrates the impact of adjusting for inflation and changes to the population size and age profile on the NHS England spending growth rate per year. Since 2013/14, the real-terms growth rate in NHS England spending has been 3.1% per year.\\n\\nThe population of England is increasing, with a growing share of people aged 65 years and older. Health care use typically increases with age. After accounting for both population growth and ageing, planned NHS spend per head will grow by 1.0% per year in real terms between 2023/24 and 2025/26. This is similar to the growth rate of 0.9% between 2013/14 and 2018/19.\\n\\nSource: Spring Statement 2025, Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (various years), HMT GDP deflator\\n\\nThe Spring Statement updated the figures on planned health spend for this year and next with no new funding announcements. The projected growth in health spend over the next year is lower than the historical long-term average but higher than that observed in the 2010s.The focus now shifts to the Spending Review in the summer, which should provide clarity on longer term funding settlements for health. This will take place amid a backdrop of major NHS reform and challenging public finances. The government is also due to publish its 10-Year Health Plan in the summer, and the Spending Review will have to deliver the necessary investment to meet the ambitions it lays out.\\n\\nPress release\\n\\nDame Jennifer Dixon, Chief Executive of the Health Foundation, responds to the Spring Statement\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nBryan Jones and Tim Horton look at the challenges to ensuring incentives are successful and make a...\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nHow can decision makers without analytical training arrive at a first, and rough, judgement about...\\n\\nReceive the latest news and updates\\n\\nfrom the Health Foundation\\n\\nCopyright The Health Foundation 2025.

It is delivered in partnership with the 15 Health Innovation Networks (HINs) in England and is hosted by UCLPartners.\\n\\nThe NIA aims to deliver on the commitment detailed within the Five Year Forward View – creating the conditions and cultural change necessary for proven innovations to be adopted faster and more systematically through the NHS, and to deliver examples into practice for demonstrable patient and population benefit. More recently the NIA was highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan.\\n\\nThe NIA’s mission is to spearhead the national acceleration of innovation and business growth of health and care innovators to help enhance patient experiences and outcomes, improve our NHS and grow employment in the UK. The NIA does this by helping its Fellows solutions to extend their footprint in the NHS and further afield as well as supporting their business growth.The NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) team, based at UCLPartners, provides coordination, administration and communications support for the Accelerator. This includes:\\n\\n– Working with partner organisations (NHS England, HINs) and supporting organisations (The Health Foundation, Department of Health and Social Care, Healthcare UK) to optimise the value of the NIA for Fellows and the wider NHS.\\n\\n– Administering the recruitment, selection and contracting process of the NIA Fellows\\n\\n– Coordinating the annual summit and launch events, quarterly events, and additional learning sessions\\n\\n– Connecting Fellows to  Health Innovation Networks (HINs) and Mentor support\\n\\n– Supporting Fellows to develop action and sprint plans\\n\\n– Identifying and meeting any gaps in the support package offered to Fellows\\n\\n– Providing secretariat for the NIA Programme Board and NIA Operational Group\\n\\n– Engaging with NHS England to optimise opportunities for the Fellows and to address systemic barriers\\n\\n– Coordinate and manage communication and engagement activities to support NIA aims\\n\\n– Providing day-to-day support to the Fellows– Regular shared learning: Further learning is shared through our quarterly INSIGHTS newsletter which features the latest blogs and news from the NIA and our Fellows.\\n\\nThe NIA exists to support the spread of innovations in the NHS in England. However, the NIA cannot offer a guaranteed route to widespread adoption across the NHS, and being on the NIA does not offer preferred supplier status.\\n\\nThe NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) is open to innovations of all types, from the UK or elsewhere, and innovators from any background. Innovations should demonstrate an evidence base from real-world use and align with one of the stated annual recruitment themes.\\n\\nApplicants can be clinicians, academics, from a public-sector, charitable or not-for-profit organisation, from a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME), or from a large corporate. Applicants can be the inventor of the innovation, the lead for it within the organisation or simply the representative of a compelling innovation and as such, wish to scale it across the NHS.\\n\\nApplicants should be able demonstrate the following:\\n\\n– Significant outcomes for significantly lower cost\\n\\n– An evidence-base for the innovation that shows it is ready to be diffused across the NHS– A personal set of strong values as well as a passion for learning and sharing insight widely\\n\\n– A commitment to scaling evidence-based innovations for patient and population benefit\\n\\n– A commitment to understanding health inequalities and to improving equity of access, experience and outcomes through innovation.\\n\\nInnovators from all genders, ethnicities and backgrounds are encouraged to apply for our accelerator.\\n\\nThe NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) holds an annual call for applicants, typically launching in September. Visit our Apply  page for the most up-to-date information.\\n\\nWhen the NIA call opens, applicants are asked to submit an online application form detailing information about themselves and their skills, experience and competencies to spread an innovation as well as their innovation, the problem it addresses, the evidence as to its effectiveness and their strategy for scaling in the NHS.\\n\\nThe NIA exists to support the spread of innovations in the NHS in England. However, the NIA cannot offer a guaranteed route to widespread adoption across the NHS, and being on the NIA does not offer preferred supplier status.When submitted, application forms are reviewed by a minimum of five assessors drawn from a range of perspectives including clinical, patient, commercial and implementation. Applications are assessed on the basis of the applicant, the innovation, and confirmation that there is no straightforward or obvious local mechanism for scaling; in other words, there needs to be a clear reason as to why the applicant needs the support of the NIA.\\n\\nOnce shortlisted, applicants are invited to a panel interview. At the same time, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) informally reviews all shortlisted applications. After the interviews, a final decision panel chaired by Sir Stephen Powis, National Medical Director at NHS England, and Chair of the NIA Programme Board, reviews the recommendations from the assessment process (application, NICE review and interview) to agree which applicants will be offered a conditional place on the NIA.At this stage, two references are requested for each Fellow – one of whom needs to be a senior representative from the Fellow’s employing organisation; the other should be from a healthcare provider/ commissioner site where your innovation is currently in use (this does not need to be an NHS site). We also undertake a period of due diligence, and request – where relevant – two years of annual accounts, a list of company directors and published annual reports. All Fellows will be asked to sign an agreement with UCLPartners (who host the NIA) before being formally announced as an NIA Fellow. An example contract will be available on the application page of the NIA website when the Call is launched. Applicants should check that they and their employing organisation would be happy to sign this contract before applying.\\n\\nThe Health Innovation Networks (HINs) are uniquely placed to identify and support the spread health innovation at pace and scale, driving the adoption and spread of innovative ideas and technologies across large populations. There are 15 across the country and these should be your first port of call for support with your innovation.\\n\\nVisit the Health Innovation Network Innovation Exchange for more information and contact details.The NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) involves an annual competition in which individuals from a range of different backgrounds apply for support in advancing an innovation they have developed.

This document has three elements.\\n\\nFirstly, a series of recommendations across five high level policy areas designed to ensure the continued growth of the sector and help the NHS make best use of HealthTech.\\n\\nNext, clinical speciality specific considerations in some of the areas in which ABHI members are active.\\n\\nFinally, there is a set of case studies illustrating how HealthTech that is available now can help the NHS achieve its three shifts from hospital to community, analogue to digital, and treatment to prevention. Alongside each technology are examples of some of the barriers preventing optimal adoption.Members, including large multinationals and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), supply products and services from syringes and wound dressings to in vitro diagnostics, surgical robots, and the delivery of remote care. The sector partners with the health and care system to save and enhance lives. The potential that HealthTech offers the UK is vast. Newer technologies such as AI, 3D printing and robotics underpin exciting and important developments in prevention, earlier and more accurate diagnosis and precision medicine. More traditional HealthTech continues to enable high-quality, cost-effective care for millions of NHS patients every day, and the use of these technologies needs to be optimised if we are to realise operational efficiencies and tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the NHS, such as the elective backlog. HealthTech is also a significant contributor to the UK’s economic growth. As the largest employer in the broader Life Sciences sector, HealthTech employs 154,000 people in 4,465 companies, with a combined turnover of £34bn.The industry has enjoyed growth of around $5%$ in recent years. It is characterised by a very large number of small companies, start-ups, and spinouts, supporting the creation of high-quality jobs and sizeable manufacturing and R&D activity across the UK.\\n\\nHowever, data demonstrates that whilst there is significant positivity about the opportunity that HealthTech provides, the reality today is that significant barriers are limiting patient access. In 2024, over a third of the sector is prioritising regulatory approvals in other markets before the UK, half of companies are continuing to delay bringing innovation to the UK and a third of companies have removed existing products form the UK market. It also shows that for the third year in a row, the HealthTech sector is increasingly viewing the US as the most attractive market globally, and most notably in creating a regulatory environment that encourages investment and innovation. Increasingly, UK patients are receiving the benefits of HealthTech innovations later than those in other countries.\\n\\nThe UK has the opportunity to become a world leader in the evaluation, development and deployment of HealthTech, but we must do things differently to ensure it is our patients, clinicians and economy that benefit.ABHI collaborated with the Imperial Centre for Sectoral Economic Performance to undertake an in-depth exploration of bold policies designed to unleash the potential of HealthTech as a pivotal driver of UK economic growth.\\n\\nThe report highlights HealthTech’s substantial economic impact, equating its Gross Value Added (GVA) to that of the biopharmaceutical sector at £13bn. However, the growth potential of HealthTech is currently constrained by capital and skills shortages, compounded by uncertainties arising from Brexit. To address these challenges, the report proposes a series of targeted policy measures to bolster investment, including tax incentives, regulatory reforms, and fostering closer collaboration with the NHS to accelerate the adoption of innovations.\\n\\nKey initiatives proposed include the recognition of product approvals from trusted international jurisdictions to streamline regulatory processes, tax reforms to enhance R&D investment, the establishment of a formal network of support to increase productivity, and the expansion of ABHI’s international accelerator programme to boost exports. These measures are designed to enhance collaboration with the NHS, foster innovation, and drive economic growth within the UK HealthTech sector, and outline how industry itself can contribute to and drive an industrial strategy.The report presents a clear vision for the future, outlining short, medium, and long-term policy recommendations that, if supported effectively, can significantly enhance efficiency and innovation in NHS healthcare delivery, while positioning the UK as a global leader in HealthTech. It projects a $50%$ increase in R&D spending, the creation of 50,000 new skilled jobs, and a potential doubling of the sector’s GVA within the next decade.\\n\\nThe report not only sets out a robust industrial strategy for HealthTech but also presents a methodology for developing this strategy from the ground up, with industry leadership and government support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of HealthTech Employees\\n\\nNumber of HealthTech Businesses\\n\\nHealthTech is the largest employer in UK life sciences. $90%$ of Businesses are SMEs.\\n\\n\\n\\n£34.3BN Turnover\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,465 Businesses\\n\\n£13bn HealthTech contributes £13bn Gross Value Added.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the right support, we forecast a $50%$ increase in global R&D HealthTech spending in the UK......and an increase of 50,000 jobs within 5 years leading to an overall doubling of the sector GVA over 10 years.\\n\\nIn September 2024, Lord Darzi published his report on the performance of the NHS in England. It laid bare the challenges that are currently faced by the NHS but also made clear the opportunity, indeed the necessity, for the UKs health and care system to embrace technology. Subsequently the Prime Minister outlined the three shifts required within the NHS: hospital to community, analogue to digital and treatment to prevention. The Prime Minister has confirmed that the number one mission of this government is growth.As recognised by Lord Darzi, “The HealthTech industry will be pivotal to realising this potential. The Independent Investigation provided identified key themes on how the NHS can be resuscitated to bring health back into people’s lives and the UK’s economy. Shifting paradigms from management of disease to enable wellbeing will empower patients to fulfil their personal end economic potential. Moving care out of hospitals and into primary care will reduce inequality and improve access. Digitalisation will build health systems able to adapt to and overcome challenges as they arise. The HealthTech sector is uniquely positioned to be the convening force that draws full value out of these themes.”To support the Invest 2035 Industrial Strategy, the UK government should leverage NHS data to drive innovation, improve patient outcomes, and boost economic growth. Establishing a national resource through a network of federated Sub-National Secure Data Environments (SNSDEs) would enable HealthTech researchers and companies to access vital healthcare data securely and ethically, fostering advancements in HealthTech solutions. The network must integrate NHS data systems across different departments, regions, and care providers to create a seamless, unified, multi-modal data landscape.\\n\\nUnlocking NHS data would allow HealthTech firms to develop evidence-based products, services and AI tools that address pressing health challenges, aligning with government goals to enhance population health and stimulate the economy. For this approach to succeed, it is crucial that these data environments are designed with meaningful stakeholder engagement, ensuring they meet the needs of researchers and innovators.\\n\\nEmbedding user-centred design and robust security frameworks from the outset will protect patient privacy while promoting trust in data-sharing practices. This strategic use of data positions the UK as a leader in health innovation, accelerates R&D commercialisation, and maximises the economic impact of the HealthTech sector, ultimately supporting the UK’s industrial strategy.To fully capitalise on all available opportunities, the UK sector requires targeted support in three critical areas: access to finance, robust manufacturing capabilities, and export support. It is important that the industrial strategy enables HealthTech companies, particularly SMEs, to secure funding, scale production, and expand into international markets. By investing in these areas, the UK can empower HealthTech to deliver transformational health solutions, contribute to environmental goals, and foster sustainable economic growth.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, innovative HealthTech SMEs need risk tolerant, long-term, patient capital to support them through the long process of product development and regulatory approval. Not surprisingly, many investors hesitate to take on that level of risk. As a result, young UK companies, whose products could save lives and improve NHS productivity, struggle, die, or move to places where capital is more plentiful, such as the US.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8132486/\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS innovation pathways, key competitors, and partnership opportunities\",\n    \"content\": \"**Open Access** This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Despite heavy regulation, there is substantial scope for new technologies and care models to not only boost patient outcomes but to do so at reduced cost to healthcare systems and consumers. Promoting innovation within national health systems such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) has been set as a key target for health care professionals and policy makers. However, while the UK has a world-class biomedical research industry, several reports in the last twenty years have highlighted the difficulties faced by the NHS in encouraging and adopting innovations, with the journey from idea to implementation of health technology often taking years and being very expensive, with a high failure rate. This has led to the establishment of several innovation pathways within and around the NHS, to encourage the invention, development and implementation of cost-effective technologies that improve health care delivery. These pathways span local, regional and national health infrastructure. They operate at different stages of the innovation pipeline, with their scope and work defined by location, technology area or industry sector, based on the specific problem identified when they were set up. In this introductory review, we outline each of the major innovation pathways operating at local, regional and national levels across the NHS, including theirhistory, governance, operating procedures and areas of expertise. The extent to which innovation pathways address current challenges faced by innovators is discussed, as well as areas for improvement and future study.**Keywords:** Entrepreneurship, Investment, Technology, Quality, SafetyThe industry of healthcare is recognised as one of the most innovative, with a record of driving multidisciplinary innovation and fostering the adoption of new technologies. Health innovations tend to drive improvements in patient care as well as making this care increasingly cost-effective. This is of particular interest to healthcare systems such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK), which seek to deliver high-quality care under tight budget constraints. The UK government’s spending on healthcare is approximately 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) and an ageing population coupled with increases in long-term health conditions may only increase this in the foreseeable future \\\\ [1\\\\]. The moral imperative towards improvements in patient care, and the need for these improvements to be cost-effective, means that facilitating innovation within and around health systems such as the NHS is a key priority for policy makers and clinical leaders. Innovation in healthcare systems such as the NHS, is partly driven by intrapreneurship whereby members of the organisation pursue innovative ideas, but is also largely propelled by entrepreneurs creating ideas and partnering with healthcare partners. The NHS Long Term Plan, published in 2019, highlighted the importance of innovation in the NHS, including the role it has in improving health outcomes, and committedthe NHS to developing the infrastructure required for innovations to thrive \\\\ [2\\\\]. It emphasised genomics as an innovation with potential to benefit both children and adults with rare diseases and/or cancer. Mental health was also highlighted as an area for future innovation efforts particularly in regards to patient reported outcomes.It has been noted that only a tiny proportion of medicines and medical devices which reach the market succeed and that the journey to market can sometimes cost in the billions of pounds and take over a decade \\\\ [3\\\\]. In recent years, there have been numerous innovation pathways made accessible to early-stage innovators seeking to incorporate new technologies, services or digital innovations in the NHS. The introduction of these pathways has formed part of the dual strategy of improving health and creating wealth within an expanded British Life Sciences industry, led by the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \\\\ [4– 6\\\\].Two key stages in an innovation process are invention and implementation, with an intervening development stage \\\\ [7\\\\]. The invention stage is largely the responsibility of the 'inventor(s)'; it consists of formulating the idea for an innovation and developing the service or product. By the time the innovator approaches an innovation pathway, the invention stage would normally be resolved. However, it does present a substantial barrier to entry in many cases due to resources needed to develop a viable product. The implementation stage, on the other hand, can be even more resource intensive, expensive and arduous. Since this stage consists of testing the innovation and incorporating it in health systems, access to patients is typically required. Diffusion of innovation is well characterised by the ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ theory proposed by Everett Rogers \\\\ [8\\\\]. The theory dictates that the rate of adoption of an innovation is initially slow until it reaches a critical mass, after which spread of the innovation is self-sustaining. Therefore, the early period of the implementation stage can be particularly challenging for innovators to navigate, both because of the resources that are required and the need to identify potential early adopters.It is in this implementation stage that innovation pathways may offer the greatest assistance to innovators. Fundamentally, these innovation pathways (or programmes) would help early-stage innovators find markets for their products. Additionally, they may help them with clinical testing and provide some funding. In some cases, they are comparable to the services that accelerators or venture capital firms might provide to early-stage start-ups but they also provide specialist support to overcome healthcare-specific barriers to entry, such as the need for testing to ensure patient safety. In addition, many innovation pathways focus on forming a network between different stakeholders, simplifying aspects of the innovation pipeline.\\n\\nThese pathways support a wide range of innovations, ranging from medical devices to the development of new therapies. In many cases, the pathways are not specific to a certain type of innovation though there are some which have funding streams dedicated to certain avenues. The advent of industry 4.0 and machine learning, as well as the synergies between different innovations, require that pathways be increasingly open given that the line between hardware and software innovations is increasingly blurred.This introductory review seeks to offer an overview of innovation pathways available within and around the NHS with a view to provide insight to innovators and map out potential routes to market entry. In doing so, the review also seeks to illustrate any overlap or deficiencies in the current system.\\n\\nFor innovations which are designed to impact patient care, a key component of their development is the need to test products and services in clinical environments. Local innovation pathways integrated in hospital trusts permit this and offer resources to innovators seeking to implement their devices or services in the NHS. In local systems, there are numerous stakeholders, including clinicians, patients, hospital trusts and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). CCGs plan health services in their local area and they are responsible for two-thirds of the total NHS budget \\\\ [9\\\\]. They work closely with hospitals and other healthcare providers in their local area to organise care pathways and may also collaborate with Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs; see below). The 2021 NHS White Paper set out further integration of local health and care, in the form of Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), which will succeed CCGs \\\\ [10\\\\]. It is yet unclear how these changes will affect the innovation role of local health systems.Individual trusts may offer their own services to innovators, such as through the Test Beds programme. The Test Beds programme is a cross-government venture funded centrally to provide hospitals with the resources to support innovations at a local level \\\\ [11\\\\]. Evidence is generated and evaluated to explore potential for wider implementation within the NHS.\\n\\nNHS Vanguard test sites are a similar venture to test beds, 50 of which were selected in 2015 to propel development of innovative care models which could then be applied nationally \\\\ [12\\\\]. Vanguard sites consist of a group of stakeholders in a local area working together to test, measure and evaluate innovative care models. Though Vanguard sites are local pilots they receive national support and are intended to lead innovation at a national level. Vanguard sites operate in a range of fields, including general practice, acute care and care homes \\\\ [13\\\\].No funding was received for this research work.

The analysis looks at how current funding compares with historical levels and how it stacks up against what is needed to meet future pressures.\\n\\nThis page was originally published on 20 March 2023 and is updated at every fiscal event. This analysis is based on the March 2025 economic forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility and Treasury figures on spending plans from March 2025.\\n\\nAll growth rates are presented in real terms (2024/25 prices) after adjusting for changes in pensions policy (see Note).\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Social Care’s (DHSC’s) total budget, which consists of revenue and capital components, sets the limit on overall health funding in England. Around 90% of DHSC revenue funding goes to NHS England to pay for the day-to-day running costs of the NHS, including for staff pay and medicines. The remaining DHSC revenue funding covers a range of programmes, including health care staff education and training and local government public health services. Capital funding is used to finance long-term investments, such as buildings and medical equipment.The 2025 Spring Statement updated the planned health care spend for 2024/25 and 2025/26 following the most recent Supplementary estimates (the mechanism by which government departments request additional in-year funding from parliament).\\n\\nTable 1 and Figure 1 show the spend for DHSC and NHS England by funding type (revenue, capital and total) from 2023/24 to 2025/26 in nominal figures (cash) and real figures (adjusted for inflation).\\n\\n2.8%\\n\\n2.6%\\n\\n10.0%\\n\\n**3.2%**\\n\\n\\\\\\\\* See Note box\\n\\n\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\* Calculated as the compound annual growth rate\\n\\nThe sum of DHSC revenue and capital might not exactly equal DHSC total due to rounding.Between 2023/24 and 2025/26, the total budget for health will see a real-terms increase of 3.2% per year. Planned revenue and capital spend will rise by 2.8% and 10.0% per year, respectively. Within planned spend, NHS England’s revenue spend will rise by 2.6% per year.\\n\\nSource: HMT Spring Statement 2025 and Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (various releases) • Real terms values are in 2024/25 prices, using the GDP deflator series from HM Treasury (March 2025).\\n\\nWe present spending figures in cash terms and real terms, using our own calculations to account for inflation. We use the GDP deflator as the standard measure of inflation. This is the deflator used by the Treasury to calculate buying power across all public services.We also remove changes to pensions policy when we present our total budget and revenue budget so our measures are comparable over the long term. These policy changes reflect an increase in the employer contribution rate to 6.3% from April 2019 (costing an estimated £2.85bn) and a further 3.1% (£1.97bn) rise from April 2024. This was separately reflected in the financial directions to NHS England in March 2024 and represents a one-off adjustment to staff pensions. This should be treated more like an accounting adjustment rather than a meaningful addition to total health spend. We choose not to include these costs to avoid distorting comparisons of health spend over time.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the real-terms growth rates in total health funding over the past 40 years under different governments. The planned increase in funding between 2023/24 and 2025/26 (3.2%) is below the pre-COVID-19 long-term average (3.7%). However, it is higher than the funding growth observed in the decade preceding the pandemic (1.6% per year).\\n\\n2.8%2.8%\\n\\n3.2%\\n\\n3.2%\\n\\n3.5%\\n\\n3.5%\\n\\n1.5%\\n\\n1.5%\\n\\nIncludes the large increase in health spend due to COVID-19\\n\\nIncludes the large increase in health spend due to COVID-19\\n\\n1.1%\\n\\n1.1%\\n\\n6.8%\\n\\n6.8%\\n\\nSource: Spring Statement 2025, House of Commons NHS Funding Expenditure (Briefing paper, July 2024, HM Treasury GDP deflator • The chart shows real-terms average growth rates for DHSC TDEL calculated using the March 2025 GDP deflator from HM Treasury.\\n\\nFigure 3 illustrates the impact of adjusting for inflation and changes to the population size and age profile on the NHS England spending growth rate per year. Since 2013/14, the real-terms growth rate in NHS England spending has been 3.1% per year.The population of England is increasing, with a growing share of people aged 65 years and older. Health care use typically increases with age. After accounting for both population growth and ageing, planned NHS spend per head will grow by 1.0% per year in real terms between 2023/24 and 2025/26. This is similar to the growth rate of 0.9% between 2013/14 and 2018/19.\\n\\nSource: Spring Statement 2025, Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (various years), HMT GDP deflator\\n\\nThe Spring Statement updated the figures on planned health spend for this year and next with no new funding announcements. The projected growth in health spend over the next year is lower than the historical long-term average but higher than that observed in the 2010s.The focus now shifts to the Spending Review in the summer, which should provide clarity on longer term funding settlements for health. This will take place amid a backdrop of major NHS reform and challenging public finances. The government is also due to publish its 10-Year Health Plan in the summer, and the Spending Review will have to deliver the necessary investment to meet the ambitions it lays out.\\n\\nPress release\\n\\nDame Jennifer Dixon, Chief Executive of the Health Foundation, responds to the Spring Statement\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nBryan Jones and Tim Horton look at the challenges to ensuring incentives are successful and make a...\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nHow can decision makers without analytical training arrive at a first, and rough, judgement about...\\n\\nReceive the latest news and updates\\n\\nfrom the Health Foundation\\n\\nCopyright The Health Foundation 2025.

It evaluates the market size and growth projections for healthcare innovation funding within the NHS, identifies key competitors and partnership opportunities, and assesses the technological trends impacting this market.\n\n### UK Healthcare Funding Landscape and NHS Government Schemes\n\nThe UK healthcare system, primarily funded through general taxation and National Insurance contributions, is characterized by a complex funding landscape with coordination between national, regional, and local levels. Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), which gained statutory footing in April 2022, play a significant role in planning and funding healthcare services within their respective regions, possessing varying funding abilities based on local needs. NHS England is allocating increasing financial responsibility to ICSs to enhance regional healthcare dissemination.\n\nSeveral NHS UK government funding schemes and initiatives are in place to encourage and support healthcare innovation:\n\n*   **Innovation Ecosystem Programme (IEP):** Commissioned by the Chief Executive of NHS England, the IEP aims to foster collaboration between the NHS and stakeholders like industry, academia, and regulatory bodies to streamline the development and adoption of healthcare innovations. It emphasizes integrating innovation into core NHS business, prioritizing innovation around key health shifts, establishing coordinated oversight and aligned funding, developing incentives, and simplifying structures for innovation.\n*   **NHS Innovation Service:** This free online platform serves as a gateway for healthcare innovators, providing information on funding opportunities, awards, and competitions to accelerate the launch of ideas or products into the NHS. It offers personalized support and outlines the key stages from creation to adoption.\n*   **Innovation and Technology Payment (ITP) Programme:** This program supports the adoption of innovations by removing financial and procurement barriers. It is a competitive process for clinically effective technologies ready for national rollout.\n*   **Medical Technology (MedTech) Funding Mandate (MTFM):** This mandate aims to ensure patients and the NHS benefit faster and more equitably from clinically effective and cost-saving medical technologies. The Health Innovation Network delivers this policy in partnership with the NHS.\n*   **Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) Healthcare:** Funded by the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) and delivered in partnership with the Health Innovation Network, SBRI Healthcare is a national program that accelerates innovative technologies in the NHS and wider health and social care system. It provides funding and support for early-stage projects and real-world implementation studies.\n*   **National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation (i4i) Programme:** This translational research funding scheme supports the development of innovative medical devices, in vitro diagnostic devices, and digital health technologies for use in the NHS or social care system. It involves a two-stage application process and collaborative projects between academia, the NHS, and industry.\n*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Health and Care Award:** This award supports AI innovators and technologies across the spectrum of development, from concept to initial NHS adoption and testing within clinical pathways.\n*   **Digital Productivity Fund:** NHS England is providing over £12 million to unlock the potential of digital technologies to support care delivery.\n*   **Innovation Fund (Workforce, Training and Education):** This fund encourages and supports initiatives contributing to workforce development through education and training related to innovation.\n\nThe government has also committed significant funding to the NHS, including over £2 billion for technology and digital improvements to increase productivity and save staff time.
