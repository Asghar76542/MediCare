Consequently, risk assessment may not be fully effective as a means to ensure safety.\\n\\nWe used a V system developmental model, in conjunction with mixed methods, including interviews and document analysis to identify user needs and requirements.\\n\\nOne way to address current challenges is through providing good guidance on the fundamental aspects of risk assessment. We designed a risk assessment framework, comprising: a risk assessment model that depicts the main risk assessment steps; risk assessment explanation cards that provide prompts to help apply each step; and a risk assessment form that helps to systematize the risk assessment and document the findings.\\n\\nWe conducted multiple group discussions to pilot the framework through the use of a representative scenario and used our findings for the user evaluation.\\n\\nUser evaluation was conducted with 10 participants through interviews and showed promising results.While the framework was recommended for use in practice, it was also proposed that it be adopted as a training tool. With its use in risk assessment, we anticipate that risk assessments would lead to more effective decisions being made and more appropriate actions being taken to minimize risks. Consequently, the quality and safety of care delivered could be improved.\\n\\n**Keywords:** risk assessment, design for safety, patient safety, risk management, guidelinesAcross the world, healthcare has devoted substantial attention to ensuring safety \\\\ [1– 4\\\\]. A number of studies have been published, such as in relation to safety culture \\\\ [4\\\\] and the reduction of harm \\\\ [5– 8\\\\]. Through continuing efforts to improve safety, reforms have been proposed that have been driven by safety–critical industries (e.g. nuclear and aviation), such as the implementation of risk management system \\\\ [9\\\\]. So far, however, such reforms have largely prioritized the investigation of incidents over their prevention in the first place \\\\ [3\\\\]. An approach which focuses on risk assessment \\\\ [10– 12\\\\] could complement this reactive practice. Risk assessment, as a part of the overarching process of risk management, aims to identify, analyse and evaluate risks that may have a negative influence on the quality and safety of the care delivered \\\\ [11, 13– 16\\\\].In the National Health Service in England (NHS England), hospitals assess a range of risks, including wrong medication, delayed discharge, patient claims and failure to comply with requirements. In so doing, hospitals provide risk assessment guidelines and training to support their staff—often frontline and risk management staff—and external authorities support and investigate hospitals to deliver safe care \\\\ [15, 17– 19\\\\]. However, despite considerable efforts being made, a number of problems have been identified with current practice. For instance, patient safety-related risks can be ignored at the organizational level, and health information technology innovations can be assumed to be safe until something goes wrong \\\\ [20\\\\]; risk assessment techniques are little-used, and if used, they may be used without training \\\\ [12, 21\\\\]; risk register systems can be used as bureaucratic data collection rather than to diagnose potential problems \\\\ [19\\\\]; there can be a lack of consultation with a sufficiently wide group of stakeholders including patients \\\\ [22\\\\]; risk assessment practice is criticized as lacking in consistency and transparency \\\\ [17\\\\]; and the risk evaluation guidance provided is insufficient, which may lead to poor decisions being made \\\\ [15\\\\]. Consequently, risk assessment may beunderutilized when attempts are made to ensure safety.The design of the RAF was then developed iteratively to improve its usefulness and usability based on the comments given and discussions between the authors.\\n\\nHaving considered all requirements, an RAF was designed by the authors, consisting of a risk assessment model, explanation cards and a risk assessment form.\\n\\nThe risk assessment model comprises four phases (identify, analyse, evaluate and manage), and each phase comprises four steps (see Fig. 2).\\n\\nFigure 2\\n\\nRisk assessment model.\\n\\nEach step is described on an A5 size double-sided explanation card (see Appendix 1), which provides a number of prompts. Table 4 summarizes these prompts at each risk assessment step. These cards are designed to assist healthcare staff in undertaking risk assessment since they bring together the key principles of risk assessment. The risk assessment form is provided to document the risk assessment findings (see Fig. 3).\\n\\nA brief summary of the prompts provided for each assessment step\\n\\n1\\\\. Describe system to be assessed\\n\\n‘What is being assessed and how does the system work?’\\n\\n− Assessment aim\\n\\n− System boundary\\n\\n− System elements and their interactions\\n\\n− System context\\n\\n2\\\\. Define undesired events\\n\\n‘What could go wrong?’\\n\\n− System description\\n\\n− Extreme casesWhile the RAF has been shown to offer great value in supporting effective risk assessment, there are some limitations to this study. First, the list of requirements is not intended to be exhaustive and constitutes only one approach to addressing the problems identified in this paper.\\n\\nSecond, the framework is built on the Safety I approach, whereas the Safety II approach might make a significant contribution to the current risk assessment practice, by considering success rather than only undesired events \\\\ [35, 36\\\\]. However, this approach has not yet been widely used and there are a number of criticisms regarding its usability and adoptability \\\\ [37– 39\\\\].\\n\\nThird, the evaluation of the RAF was limited. The evaluation interviews were not designed to provide duplicating and reversing questions to establish the reliability of the responses. Additionally, participants’ views on the proposed RAF could have been biased since they evaluated the framework based on the explanations presented rather than on their experience of using it. While the authors of this paper aimed to minimize such limitations by conducting regular review meetings, a control study could be conducted to see the real impact of the framework in comparison to typical current risk assessment practice in hospitals.Risk assessment supports decisions made in relation to potential undesired events. Despite significant efforts of healthcare professionals and organizations, there is a potential to improve current risk assessment practice in hospitals. In this paper, we designed an RAF to guide healthcare staff in risk assessment and to address existing challenges of risk assessment. This was subsequently evaluated to investigate its practical use.\\n\\nThe framework brings the principles of risk assessment together and learns from the experience of healthcare staff in risk assessment. It uses simplified risk terminology to minimize misconceptions and encourages: convening a multidisciplinary team, describing the system to be assessed, defining potential undesired events based on the system description, determining a wide range of contributory factors, considering all potential consequences, determining tolerability of a risks by considering multiple factors and considering control actions to minimize the potential undesired events defined.\\n\\nThe framework can be used as a training tool to guide in effective risk assessment as well as a tool to assess risks in healthcare settings. We believe that the framework can contribute to the quality and safety of care when it is used effectively and the assessment findings are implemented.This work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) East of England, at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust.

The lingering effects of COVID-19, Russia's war in Ukraine, the resulting energy crisis, and global trade tensions have all contributed to rising inflation, uncertainty, and fiscal stress. The result has been public budgets stretched thin, with governments forced to make difficult trade-offs.\\n\\nAt the end of 2024, global public debt hit 93 percent of GDP, surpassing $100 trillion. In the United Kingdom, public debt stands at 96 percent of GDP, with debt interest reaching £107 billion in 2023/24. That's nearly 9 percent of government spending—money no longer available for essential services.At the same time, health needs continue to mount. Over the past three decades, UK health spending as a share of GDP has doubled—from under 6 percent to over 11 percent by 2024 and from well below to now slightly above the advanced economy average. Despite this, the NHS faces persistent backlogs, and pressures from an ageing population and chronic disease burden are only intensifying. The result is a widening gap: rising demand for health and preventive services, but shrinking fiscal space to respond.\\n\\nThe NHS faces persistent backlogs, and pressures from an ageing population and chronic disease burden are only intensifying.\\n\\nThis fiscal squeeze has reignited interest in delivering 'more with less'. The UK's Government's newly established Office for Value for Money (OVfM) has been tasked with rooting out inefficiencies across government spending (PDF). It builds on previous efforts, such as the National Audit Office's Value for Money (VfM) audits and the Cabinet Office's _Sourcing Playbook_, which provides detailed guidance on structuring public service contracts to maximise value and accountability.Alongside this focus on efficiency, appetite is growing for innovative financing which mobilises private capital to achieve public goals. The United Kingdom has arguably been a world leader in impact investing for some years, with many organisations—such as Big Society Capital and the Impact Investing Institute—championing this approach. What is new here is that in late 2024 the UK Government itself launched a new Social Impact Investment Vehicle. This initiative builds on the earlier, smaller-scale Life Chances Fund and is co-led by HM Treasury and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its goal is to crowd in investment from private investors, philanthropies, and public agencies for programmes that deliver positive social impact. As HM Treasury put it, investors are ready to “deliver a better Britain” through partnerships with government.\\n\\nThis trend is not unique to the United Kingdom. Canada's Social Finance Fund and Portugal's Social Innovation Fund are part of a broader global movement experimenting with new financing models for social outcomes.Among the most discussed innovative financing mechanisms are impact bonds—also called social outcomes partnerships. These instruments combine elements of public-private partnerships with outcomes-based contracting. Private investors provide upfront funding for programmes and government repays the investment, with a return, only if agreed outcomes are achieved.\\n\\nImpact bonds are particularly appealing for preventive health interventions, where results can take time to materialise. By tying payments to outcomes, they aim to encourage innovation, reduce risk to the public sector, and focus spending on what works.\\n\\nAnother tool is blended finance, where public or donor funding is used to attract private investment. This could involve guarantees, concessional loans, or tax incentives to make high-impact projects more attractive to private investors. A prominent example is the European Fund for Strategic Investments, which combines European Union budget guarantees with private capital to fund infrastructure, innovation, and health initiatives across the continent.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, there have been proposals for a “Blended Prevention Fund” to bring pension funds into local preventive health programmes. These efforts reflect an ongoing search for ways to mobilise new capital without immediately increasing public spending.Done well these models can unlock new resources, especially for prevention and early intervention—areas which are often underfunded in traditional budgets. They can also promote long-term thinking in systems too often driven by short-term pressures. For countries like the United Kingdom, where fiscal constraints are the new normal, these tools offer a way to pilot and scale promising approaches without overburdening public finances upfront.\\n\\nBut there are important caveats. Most innovative financing initiatives remain small in scale and complex to implement. Impact bonds, for example, account for less than 1 percent of the global impact investment market. High transaction costs, lengthy contract negotiations, and the need for rigorous evaluation all act as barriers to growth. Many programmes also suffer from limited transparency, insufficient evidence on effectiveness and value for money, and the appropriateness of using public funds to underwrite private returns—particularly for essential services that rightly fall within the state's responsibility.Critics argue that these models can shift public risk to future taxpayers, especially when returns to private investors are guaranteed regardless of long-term impact. In the worst cases, they risk creating perverse incentives: focusing attention on easily measurable or low-risk outcomes, rather than addressing deep-rooted public health challenges like health inequality or the social determinants of health.\\n\\nMoreover, these mechanisms do not generate 'new' money. They simply reallocate costs over time, often at a higher price (PDF) due to investor premiums. In times of tight budgets, it is essential that governments remain clear-eyed about when and where these tools truly add value.\\n\\nInnovative finance should be seen as a complement, not a substitute, for robust public investment in health. When used strategically and transparently, instruments like impact bonds, outcome-based contracts, and blended finance can play a valuable role—particularly in catalysing prevention and improving long-term outcomes.\\n\\nInnovative finance should be seen as a complement, not a substitute, for robust public investment in health.But they are no silver bullet. Their use must be carefully targeted, evaluated, and aligned with broader system goals. Without proper oversight, they risk distracting from the more urgent and structural reforms health systems need: workforce development, digital transformation, and more equitable funding models.\\n\\nAs governments look for ways to navigate economic uncertainty while meeting rising public health needs, innovative finance offers promise—but only if used wisely, transparently, and in service of the public good.\\n\\nMehdi Shiva is a research leader at RAND Europe.\\n\\nCommentary\\n\\nNov 27, 2024\\n\\nProject\\n\\nMar 17, 2025\\n\\nCommentary\\n\\nMar 14, 2025\\n\\nRAND is a research organization that develops solutions to public policy challenges to help make communities throughout the world safer and more secure, healthier and more prosperous.

The overarching vision and priorities of the strategy have been developed to be relevant to all parts of this broad sector. However, we recognise that some specific segments of the market face particular challenges. In these areas, we will work to apply the principles of the strategy at a more granular level. This may be in the form of tailoring the broader elements of the strategy to best fit the needs of a particular market, or through supporting the aims of the strategy through the addition of specific actions to tackle singular issues.\\n\\nThis approach has already been used with success in other areas of the health and social care system. There is significant ongoing work around the use of digital and artificial intelligence both in medtech products and as standalone products, and during the pandemic dedicated strategies were adopted to ensure sufficient respiratory, renal and enteral capacity.\\n\\nWe expect that the areas of focus will change and expand over time as market conditions and clinical requirements change. At present, we believe there are 2 main medtech areas that would benefit from an increased focus:The vast majority of medtech spend is in secondary care, but there is also significant spend, roughly £1 billion a year, in community care, including primary care. These medtech items are used day to day by patients in the community and are also known as appliances. They include continence products, such as stoma or ostomy bags, dressings for long-term wound care, and reagent strips for home testing (for example, of blood glucose or ketones).\\n\\nFigure 8: components of the Part IX Drug Tariff\\n\\nThe figure illustrates the 4 components:\\n\\nAlthough these products are typically identical to those used in secondary care, in the community they are sourced and supplied through fundamentally different supply chains and mechanisms to reach patients. Suppliers apply to be listed on Part IX of the Drug Tariff, patients are prescribed products (in the same way as medicines) and have their prescriptions dispensed either through local pharmacies or, given the specialist nature of many of the products, through dedicated dispensing appliance contractors (DACs).The mechanics by which appliances are provided to patients in the community have changed little since they were established in the 1980s, in stark contrast to the rapid development of medtech and the substantial evolution of community care services over this same period.\\n\\nWhile the fundamental principles of these mechanics, Part IX prescription and reasonable choice remain generally sound, there is opportunity to review and improve these arrangements to better reflect today’s operational environment, and to deliver better outcomes for patients and the taxpayer.\\n\\nThe specific differences in mechanics and supply chain bring opportunities and challenges alike, and these need to be factored into a more focussed strategy for medtech in the community:\\n\\nThese actions will help deliver the following benefits:\\n\\nMedtech products play a vital role in diagnostic services, which are crucial to supporting preventative care and the delivery of world leading, safe and effective treatment. The NHS carries out over 1.5 billion diagnostic tests every year and more than 85% of clinical pathways involve a diagnostic test (see Item 5: diagnostics capacity). Diagnostics are a significant part of the UK Life Sciences sector, with £2.9 billion in turnover and employing more than 15,000 people in the UK.Figure 9: components that sit under diagnostics\\n\\nThe figure illustrates the 5 components of diagnostics are:\\n\\nDiagnostic services include imaging services, pathology, endoscopy, physiological measurement and genomics. All these services are vital to ensuring that patients get the right care quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nOver the last 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of fast and accurate diagnostic testing, genome sequencing and the existence of robust diagnostic infrastructure to process and share results. The wide adoption of home lateral flow testing has demonstrated the potential for increased use of diagnostics outside formal clinical settings to support earlier diagnosis.\\n\\nDemand for diagnostics is continuing to rise and waiting lists have increased following the reduction in availability of services during the pandemic, so it is vital that we continue to improve and expand our diagnostic capacity. In tackling these challenges, we have an opportunity to move to a more patient-centric model of care, and to better connect our world-leading life sciences sector with the NHS to transform elective diagnostics with the latest technologies.Community diagnostic centres (CDCs) provide a range of elective diagnostics away from acute facilities. These centres will reduce pressure on hospitals, improve patients’ access to tests, increase capacity, and speed up diagnosis and referral for treatment through a more productive, efficient, personalised and integrated model of care.\\n\\nInnovation will play a critical role in the future of diagnostic services, so we must ensure that research and development is directed towards diagnostics in a way that maximises impact. We need to make sure that we maintain the focus on advancing diagnostic technologies and adoption across the NHS to support better treatment and outcomes for patients and help the NHS to focus resources where they are most needed.\\n\\nDigital transformation of diagnostics through new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) will also enable the current imaging and pathology workforce to optimise their working patterns and better support the growth in capacity of imaging services. This will transform how people receive their tests and test results, delivering more accurate and timely results.\\n\\nBased on broad engagement across the diagnostics sector, 4 areas for priority action in the diagnostics sector have been identified that will facilitate increased access, earlier diagnosis, innovation adoption and efficiency.\\n\\nThese 4 diagnostic priorities are:We must support the NHS to adopt more efficient models of care that will help tackle the elective backlog. We will establish up to 160 CDCs by March 2025, supported by appropriate workforce plans. We will build pathology network maturity, and deliver enhanced digital infrastructure that will improve efficiency, interoperability and availability of diagnostics across the health system.\\n\\nWe will work to improve patient outcomes through early detection and diagnosis, meaning patients can receive treatment when there is a better chance of achieving a complete cure. We will utilise additional capacity and increased public awareness and acceptance of self-administered testing built through the pandemic to increase uptake of early screening. We will also enable earlier diagnosis of cancer and detection of relapses through the rapid introduction of new genomic technologies.We will provide clear demand signalling to industry to support innovation in the UK diagnostics sector. The existing NHSE Demand Signalling Programme will work with a clinical advisory group to identify and drive innovations that support early diagnosis and will have the greatest impact on health outcomes. An NHS-led review of diagnostics commissioning will ensure benefits across the pathway are recognised, and that regulatory and evaluation processes are simplified and clarified. This aligns with the broader medtech priorities of national clinical leadership for products, clear demand signalling and streamlined evaluation.\\n\\nWe will use the legacy of investment during COVID-19 to ensure preparedness for any future pandemic. UKHSA, through the Centre for Pandemic Preparedness, will work in conjunction with NHSE and the pathology networks to ensure that diagnostic facilities are ready for future pandemics and that existing infrastructure and latent capacity is capable of being mobilised.\\n\\nThese actions will help deliver the following benefits:\\n\\nMedtech is a large and diverse industry that plays a significant role in both the UK economy and the UK health and care system. It has largely operated without significant central intervention and approaches to date have been driven by need rather than through a planned strategic approach.Medtech products and markets have developed rapidly, and together with the changes brought about by the UK leaving the EU and lessons we have learnt from COVID-19 we need to act now to ensure that the sector is sustainable for the future, and that our resources are focussed where they will improve the overall health of the nation.\\n\\nWe will do this by making sure the health and social care system can reliably access safe, effective and innovative medical technologies that support the continued delivery of high-quality care and excellent patient outcomes in a way that makes the best use of taxpayer money, delivered by our vision of ‘right product, right price, right place’.\\n\\nRecognising the work that is already underway within the sector, we see 4 key priority areas for fresh national focus:\\n\\nThis strategy sets our vision for medtech, and the central strategic elements where we expect to see different and increased focus over the next 5 to 10 years. In developing these plans, we will be sure to consider several factors that will be critical to success:We are committed to realising the benefits that advances in medtech can bring, both to the individual patient, and to the UK economy. We call on our colleagues across industry and the UK health and social care system to share our ambition and work with us to create lasting positive change. We will continue to engage collaboratively with all stakeholders and consult on proposed changes ahead of delivery and implementation.\\n\\nThe medtech strategy will deliver the following actions:\\n\\nAn implementation plan for the strategy will be published in early 2023, outlining the planned achievements for each priority.\\n\\nThe implementation plan will aim to achieve the following:\\n\\nThe implementation plan will aim to achieve the following:\\n\\nThe implementation plan will aim to achieve the following:\\n\\nThe implementation plan will aim to achieve the following:\\n\\nDuring the pandemic response, an Oxygen, Ventilation, Medical Devices and Clinical Consumables Programme was set up jointly by DHSC and NHSE to deliver a 4-phase programme of COVID-19 response.

Below, we outline a structured approach to calculating a medical device's benefit-risk ratio.\\n\\nClinical benefits must be demonstrated through clinical evidence following use of the subject device, typically from:\\n\\nThe benefit of a medical device is determined by considering the severity of the benefit and its frequency of occurrence in clinical literature. The formula used for this calculation is:\\n\\nBenefit = ∑ ( Severity × Observed frequency )\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nBy summing all reported benefits, an overall benefit score is obtained.\\n\\nRisks can be identified from two types of sources:\\n\\nFor PMS data, the risk calculation follows this formula:Risk = ∑ ( Severity × Observed frequency )\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nTotal device uses is usually a more appropriate denominator when calculating the observed frequency, rather than device sales, if the device has a usage pattern that differs from a simple one-to-one sale-to-use relationship (e.g. software used multiple times daily).\\n\\nBy summing all reported risks, an overall risk score is obtained.\\n\\nOnce both the benefit and risk values are calculated, the benefit-risk ratio is assessed:\\n\\nBenefit-risk ratio = Total benefit score / Total risk score\\n\\nA ratio greater than 1 indicates that the benefits outweigh the risks, supporting a favourable benefit-risk profile. Conversely, a ratio below 1 may require risk mitigation strategies or additional justification for device approval.\\n\\nA quantitative approach to risk-benefit assessment provides an objective method for evaluating the safety and efficacy of a medical device. By systematically analysing clinical literature and PMS data, manufacturers can make data-driven decisions to support regulatory submissions and ongoing post-market evaluations.\\n\\nFreelance Medical Writer, writing clinical evaluation documents for medical devices that secure compliance with regulatory requirementsThank you Mantra Systems for this post.

This paper overviews critical variables, advantages, disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses of this tool, according to the ISO 31000 risk management framework.Risk assessment is one of the key stages in the Risk Management Process and involves specific steps: identifying hazards, analyzing and evaluating all possible risks. Several methods are developed to assess risks in the literature. A risk matrix method, also called “decision matrix risk assessment (DMRA) technique”, is a systematic approach used to determine the risk level and to compare different risks and define which threats need to be controlled first. The actors involved in risk assessment are called on to manage different issues related to the choice of the most appropriate methodological approach, the assessment of the adequacy of the existing control measures, the articulation of risk consequence domains, the definition of the impact-consequences, the explanation of risk likelihood scales and the development of a risk matrix.\\n\\nWe highlighted a number of recommendations in order to address these issues, especially useful when healthcare organizations provide insufficient guidance on how to use risk matrices as well as what to do in response to the existing criticisms on their use.\\n\\n**Keywords:** healthcare risk analysis, risk matrix, consequences-likelihood analysisRisk is an essential part of everyday life and risks are unavoidable in any complex program. 1 A common definition of risk is “the chance of something happening that will have an impact on the achievement of the stated organizational objectives”. 2 Risk management is defined in the literature as “all the activities connected with hazard identification, assessment, selection of appropriate responses and risk monitoring”. 3 A general risk management scheme, within the international risk management standards ISO 31000, consist of a few key stages, namely: (i) organizational context definition (ii) risk identification, (iii) risk analysis, (iv) risk evaluation, (v) risk treatment, (vi) monitoring and review, and (vii) communication and consultation, that covers the whole process ( Figure 1). 4 In this scheme risk assessment is the term that covers three successive stages: risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. 5–8 Risk identification is used to find, recognize and describe the hazard that could affect the achievement of objectives. 2 Risk analysis is finalized to understand the nature, sources and causes of the risks identified and to estimate the level of risk; and risk evaluation is used to compare risk analysis results with risk criteria in order to determine whetheror not a specified level of risk is acceptable or tolerable and identifying where additional action is required. 7 Thus, risk assessment allows decision-makers to determine, based on the identified and analyzed risks, which risks will be treated and with what priority, becoming a key part of the decision-making process because it can help to identify possible options for risk management, according to the level of risk identified. 9, 10 Risk management has become one of the main objectives of individuals, organizations, and governments in pursuing their goals since there is the possibility that things do not go as planned. Healthcare organizations are high-risk and highly complex with multiple dimensions of mutual interdependence (professional, technological, organizational/managerial) and risk management is very important, because even a low-risk event could have serious consequences affecting patients, personnel, costs and the hospital’s reputation. Risk assessment and risk ranking tools have been developed in complex and high-reliability and highly-resilient industries, such as nuclear power generation, manufacturing and aviation have recently been adopted in the healthcare sector, to specifically address patient safety. There are different methods of analysis that take into account two common parameters, presence of the hazard and its severity, and they differ in how these two factors are evaluated and combined to estimatethe risk. 11 One of these methodologies use a qualitative or semi-quantitative risk assessment matrix to identify, assess and rank the risks associated with threats and to determine which threats need to be controlled first. The comparative simplicity and apparent ease of use in this approach likely contributed to widespread adoption, including a generic international standard for risk assessment techniques in support of risk management. 12–14 In this context, hospital staff are often called upon to decide whether given risks are high or low, nevertheless participants need clear definitions of what is considered “high” versus “low”. 15 This critical literature review highlights the key variables, advantages, disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses of the whole risk analysis phase for the healthcare organizations, engendering a number of recommendations when risk analysis is conducted using a risk matrix.Figure 1\\n\\nRisk management process\\n\\nIn the broad based risk assessment process, the goal of risk analysis is to realize and develop a better understanding of the risk. 6 Risk analysis in healthcare involves consideration of the sources of risk, their consequences and the likelihood that those consequences may occur with patient safety, persons involved in providing healthcare, the organization itself, in an effort to distinguish minor acceptable clinical risks from the unacceptable major risks and to provide data to assist the subsequent evaluation and treatment of risks. 9, 16A risk matrix method, also called “decision matrix risk assessment (DMRA) technique”, is a systematic approach used in risk assessment process to determine and to rank the risk level, to compare different risks and to define which threats need to be controlled first and to help minimize the probability of potential risks. It responds to the general principle that the risk level depends mainly on two variables: severity of harm and occurrence probability of this harm or likelihood. 12 Easy to implement and graphically appealing, it can be applied even where data are limited and does not require specialized expertise, representing a quick way to graphically recognize the issues of the risk, the severity of the hazard and the frequency/probability. 13, 17, 18Consequently, risk matrix has become a popular decision-support tool in both the public and private sectors, frequently used also in healthcare organizations, because it standardizes the process of grading the risk. It provides a visualization for both presence of the likelihood of an event occurring and its effects if the event occurs, giving direct insight into the way these two elements contribute to the overall risk, and this facilitates discussions amongst stakeholders regarding the identified risks. 11, 19 A risk matrix also assists the risk manager, the board and all risk-owners to decide the priority level for corrective actions/controls, necessary within the department/unit/facility, depending on the score. Finally, a risk matrix also helps to assess and document changes in risk before and after control measures are implemented. 20The choice of the most appropriate methodological approach to risk rating estimation is the first organizational decision in risk analysis. Organizations can choose among quantitative, qualitative and semi-quantitative methods. The quantitative approach ( Table 1) calculates numeric values associated to each component that results after risk evaluation. 21 Therefore risk impact, risk probability and risk level are determined in terms of numeric values. 22 For example, risk levels for patient injury from a particular medical procedure could be defined through the assessment of the probability based on the historical frequency or available statistical data and numerical values expressive of the potential impact ranging from minor injuries to severe trauma leading to the death. 23\\n\\nQuantitative AnalysisUnlike the quantitative ones, the qualitative methods do not express the size of likelihood or the consequences by means of figures ( Table 2). The value of likelihood and impact/consequence levels of a specific event are given by description using a pre-defined rating scale. 23 This generally implies an inaccurate determination of risk and it is used in all those cases in which calculating the numerical value of risks is impossible or difficult. 22 For example, when numerical data are inadequate or unavailable, resources are limited (in terms of budget or expertise) and time allowed is scarce, a single person or team, in these cases, can collect information using structured interviews/questionnaires (also with experts in the area of interest), specialist and expert judgments, evaluations using multi-disciplinary groups, and benchmarking methods. 16, 24\\n\\nQualitative AnalysisAll authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether that is in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, or in all these areas; took part in drafting, revising or critically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.\\n\\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\\n\\nArticles from Risk Management and Healthcare Policy are provided here courtesy of **Dove Press**\\n\\nConnect with NLM\\n\\n\\nNational Library of Medicine\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\n8600 Rockville Pike\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nBethesda, MD 20894# Risk Analysis in Healthcare Organizations: Methodological Framework and Critical Variables## PERMALINK\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The `gov.uk` medical technology strategy provides context on NHS innovation priorities and challenges, but lacks a quantitative risk evaluation framework.

All of the NQB’s guidance is available on the webpage: NHS England » National Quality Board publications for integrated care systems\\n\\nThe NQB would like to specifically thank the NHS England South West Clinical Quality Team for its work in developing these principles.\\n\\nThis document complements the National Quality Board’s (NQB) other guidance for integrated care systems (ICSs), and particularly the National Risk Response and Escalation Guidance which sets out how quality risks and concerns should be managed in ICSs.  The document sets out key principles to use when assessing risks in environments or scenarios that are rapidly changing or based on multiple factors (e.g. multiple services/organisations involved). Whether it is unprecedented levels of pressure, unit and care home closures, new technologies, IT systems or medicines coming onto the market, pandemics or public health emergencies, health and care organisations are faced with increasing complexity.Individual health and care organisations, including providers, Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and Local Authorities, must ensure their approach to risk management meets recognised standards and best practice (key guidance on risk assessment in health and care includes the National Patient Safety Agency’s Risk Matrix for Risk Managers, 2008), including: agreed risk appetite statements; common language and scoring; and risk frameworks clearly linked to associated accountability and governance frameworks, which cover quality alongside wider risk frameworks (e.g. operational, financial).\\n\\nHowever, in multi-factorial and complicated situations, collaborative approaches and whole system solutions are also required.  This document has been designed to help those working in these scenarios.  It does not provide detailed operational guidance on “the how”; how to develop common language and scoring, how to develop system risk appetites etc.  However, it does provide a set of guiding principles, and through testing with systems we hope to provide more detailed learning on deploying the principles set out in the document.Other examples include a public emergency (e.g. large fire) or the withdrawal of medication from the market. In these cases, there will be a need for teams to make rapid decisions that involve multiple perspectives and partners. The risk profile in one or more organisations may need revising, or there may be a need to **share risk** across the system in **order to achieve a decision that is least worse, best possible or for the ‘greater good’.** Who will own and manage the shared risks? How will the response be coordinated and who will monitor it? What changes are needed?\\n\\nIn order to answer these questions, those involved must follow a number of key principles. These principles cover culture, systems, structures, policy and support, all of which are needed for effective risk assessment and management.\\n\\nProcesses fail when there is no accountability to deliver and no mechanism to coordinate and assure, which is where the system role is important. Ensuring that accountability lines are clearly defined and communicated to everyone involved, including timescales and ongoing maintenance, is a priority. The ICB’s role in providing objective challenge on risk assessments for health should also be recognised.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) across system partners may be helpful. The role of System Quality Groups in coordinating improvement and risk management should also be understood and agreed, as well as System Coordination Centres for health.\\n\\nThis document sets out the need to review how risk management is implemented in fast-changing and multi-factorial environments, and the key principles to support this approach. In working with systems, we intend to develop more detailed understanding of how to apply these principles and frameworks, including the role of ICBs vis-à-vis wider system partners. Below, we set out a first step in terms of how risk matrixes can be updated to be used in integrated care systems. Further examples are provided in Annex A.\\n\\nThe example in Figure 3 below has been system tested when developing these principles and refers to significant pressure in the urgent and emergency care pathway, and assessment as to whether ambulances should be diverted to another provider.  In the example:\\n\\n**Scenario:** Decision to divert ambulances from one organisation due to exceptional pressures within the Emergency Department.\\n\\n**Figure 3:** Example of risk assessment across an integrated care systemImage description: The image is a risk assessment matrix that evaluates various organisational entities across different areas of impact. The risk scores range from 4 to 25, with color-coding to indicate low (green), medium (yellow), and high (red) risk levels.\\n\\nThe matrix shows the initial risk assessment for Organisation A, which had an “extreme/high risk” rating. The revised assessment for Organisation A reduced the risk to “medium.”\\n\\nFor Organisation B, the initial and revised assessments both indicated “medium risk.” Organisation C also had a “medium risk” rating in both the initial and revised assessments.\\n\\nThe initial assessment for Organisation D, which involves sub-contracted alcohol assessment, referral, and advice, resulted in a “high risk” rating. The revised assessment for Organisation D is not shown.\\n\\nIn the example:The example illustrates how assessment through a system lens opens up new mitigations/ interventions based on least worse/best possible scenarios, but also the need to continue assessing dynamically to mitigate the risks as best as possible. The example could be broadened to assess risks in other parts of the system. For example, the decision to divert ambulances may make it harder for discharge teams at organisation C to discharge people and may mean that the person being discharged may consequently require more community, social care and primary care support.As risk management within health and care continues to mature, it has become more important than ever to ensure that risk assessment is effective, systems-based and responsive. The organisations involved in delivering and commissioning health and care must ensure that their risk frameworks and processes are being used effectively in line with key standards, and that those assessing risks have the skills and capabilities needed to do this effectively. At the same time, there is also a need to consider the role of a collaborative approach to risk assessment in today’s operating environment: one that recognises that different organisations and system partners must not only understand each other’s key risks and priorities, but also support each other to manage them. The NQB hopes that the principles set out in this document provide a useful reference and starting point to those assessing and managing risks across integrated care systems.\\n\\nScenario: Decision to close an independent hospital due to quality concerns raised by the CQC and removal of the provider’s registration within a short time frame (such as 28 days closure).\\n\\n\\\\*Known risk factors for closed cultures in mental health hospitals, which can lead to breaches of people’s human rights, including patient abuse.Image description: The image is a 5×5 risk assessment matrix that evaluates various risk factors across areas like setting, safety, experience, workforce, and regulation.

Innovation will also be a key enabler of the three shifts government wants to see – from sickness to prevention, hospital to community, and analogue to digital.\\n\\nYet innovation in the NHS doesn’t happen in isolation. It operates within a larger ‘ecosystem’ of research, funding, people and infrastructure for the development, testing and uptake of new ideas. Recognition that this ecosystem could work better across the UK led NHS England, in 2023, to ask Roland Sinker, Chief Executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Health Foundation governor, to look at how to improve it.Published in late November, Sinker’s report – now part of an ongoing Innovation Ecosystem Programme (IEP) – provides a summary of familiar pain points in the system, including disjointed policy and regulatory hurdles, risk-averse culture and difficulty establishing partnerships between the NHS, academia and industry. But the report’s analysis and recommendations go beyond previous innovation reviews in important ways too. Not only in calling for greater clarity on priorities and consolidation of funding, but in avoiding several problems that have bedevilled previous thinking on innovation policy.\\n\\nIn Sinker’s words, ‘What is different here is the consistent, coordinated, long-term approach to fixing what is holding us back, and fixing it collaboratively.’ As the findings and recommendations of Sinker’s review are considered in the development of the upcoming 10-Year Health Plan, Innovation and Adoption Strategy, and Life Sciences Sector Plan, it will be critical that this approach is preserved – particularly in the areas we highlight below.First, while the review echoes previous reports in making simplifying national governance of innovation activity and funding a core recommendation, it goes further in calling for innovation funders to work together to establish fewer but larger funding pots for an agreed set of national innovation priorities. This is welcome. The Health Foundation’s own research into the UK’s complex patchwork of innovation programmes found that the overall shape of the technology and innovation ecosystem doesn’t necessarily reflect an intentional design, but rather has evolved from a myriad of decisions and activities by different organisations, each with its own priorities, creating a fragmented approach. As Sinker highlights, clarity is badly needed ‘ on who is responsible for what and when’.\\n\\nConsolidating parts of the system could not only make it more navigable for innovators but also provide clarity on roles for organisations that are a key part of the ecosystem itself, such as health innovation networks. Integrated care boards are another important piece of the jigsaw – and the Health Foundation’s new programme on Accelerating Innovation Systems aims to complement Sinker’s proposals by helping ICBs explore the roles they can play in spreading innovation. As the IEP notes, buy in from all the constituent parts will be essential to achieve clarity and deliver change.Too often, previous innovation reviews have tended to let industrial strategy considerations, particularly in relation to life sciences and clinical trials, pull the focus of thinking towards research and early-stage innovation, at the cost of later stages. By contrast, the IEP review rightly recognises that it is the testing and adoption of innovation that holds the real prize for the NHS.\\n\\nThe Health Foundation has long advocated for a greater focus on funding and support for adopters to better assist the spread of innovations. So, it is encouraging to see the review acknowledge that while the UK has a strong history of developing innovations, the record in the NHS on adopting and spreading them is generally much weaker.\\n\\nRebalancing the ecosystem towards the later stages of the innovation pipeline is therefore essential. This should include an integral focus on promoting provider capability and readiness for adoption, as well as providing implementation support in critical areas like staff training and evaluation. There is useful learning to draw on here from the Health Foundation’s Adopting Innovation programme.This brings us to a third way the review has helped move thinking forwards. An assumption often made about the uptake of innovation has been that the barriers to adoption are primarily behavioural, and therefore what is required are new incentives or an ever-louder championing of innovation. Although the IEP echoes this in calling for the system to send strong signals that innovation and research are important, it also firmly recognises the other part of the equation: the skills, capabilities and capacity needed for successful adoption and how they can be nurtured. It won’t be sufficient simply to champion innovation – capacity, capability and consensus must also be created.\\n\\nIn addition to factors such as training and implementation support highlighted above, the review also attempts to tackle the vital issue of workforce capacity. Although productivity-enhancing innovations can help ease pressures on the NHS workforce, workforce shortages can also pose a barrier to innovation. It is often assumed that developing an innovation is the primary challenge and that adoption and scale will naturally follow. But many complex innovations require similarly complex processes and skills to integrate them into health care delivery.As such, introducing innovations often has short-term capacity requirements while staff step back, design new ways of working and try them out. With staff stretched to capacity, innovation risks being squeezed out. Greater focus is required on the creation of both capability and opportunity to adopt innovations within the NHS. As such, the review’s call for staff time to be protected is welcome, but ideas will be needed for how to make this happen under challenging circumstances.\\n\\nThe IEP calls on other relevant programmes within NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to agree when and how to deliver the recommendations. It highlights that success ‘…will require collective accountability and resourcing for 3 to 10 years, with a clear strategy that all partners are signed up to and eager to support.’\\n\\nSinker’s report has arrived at a busy time, including with work underway on the creation of the new 10-Year Health Plan. This and other forthcoming strategies on innovation and life sciences offer an opportunity to take forward Sinker’s recommendations with national backing. In doing so, it will be critical that they do not lose those aspects of Sinker’s analysis that offer a chance to move beyond previous reviews and bring the benefits of adopting innovation at scale into the NHS.\\n\\nBlogThe Health Foundation’s Improvement team share some findings from their mapping of the health care...\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nCandida Perera on our Accelerating Innovation Systems initiative and the role ICBs might play in the...\\n\\nShare this page:\\n\\nReceive the latest news and updates\\n\\nfrom the Health Foundation\\n\\nCopyright The Health Foundation 2025.

As the Health Innovation Network we remain the collective voice of the 15 local health innovation networks. We will continue to work with healthcare networks and businesses to support the spread of all types of innovation within the NHS.\\n\\nBlog\\n\\n20 January 2025\\n\\nEarlier this month, Sir Keir Starmer outlined his vision for transforming the NHS, stating “ _we need an NHS hungry for innovation_”. As a part of the Health Innovation Network, I welcome the new Government’s focus on transformation, having seen first-hand the huge productivity and patient benefit gains of many innovations associated with the three shifts: analogue to digital, hospital to community and treatment to prevention.\\n\\nWhile technology is often the focus of transformation, implementing new ideas successfully in our health and care system – both pathways and products – will require the NHS to prioritise organisational and cultural shifts, ensuring that behavioural changes and practical support are put in place for long-term adoption.\\n\\nCentral to this is the need for our health and care system to become more comfortable with the uncertainty associated with innovating; To create an NHS hungry for innovation, we must increase our collective appetite for risk. Risk is not about patient safety.Innovation inherently carries a level of risk because if it didn’t, it most likely wouldn’t be innovative. Risk in this context never relates to patient safety, which remains of the utmost importance and assessed separately and addressed through robust regulatory processes and co-production.\\n\\nIn health innovation, the risk is in relation to the assessment of the impact of innovation. Simply put, the risk that it might not deliver on the time, cost or resource improvement intended, creates unintended consequences or simply doesn’t work out as planned. For example, making an administration element of a patient journey more efficient in one element of the pathway, causing bottlenecks elsewhere.\\n\\nThis inherent risk, if managed safely and appropriately, should not dissuade health and care teams from embracing innovation.\\n\\n**_Navigating failure and risk_**\\n\\nEmbracing risk is a big part of the culture required to innovate. By clearly defining risk appetite, it signals that some degree of failure is acceptable as part of innovating, which leads to people being more likely to propose bold ideas and learn from setbacks.Public sector organisations are often very risk adverse due to public scrutiny and accountability. Our experience of working with academia, NHS and life science partners, has demonstrated that successful innovation teams aren’t afraid to take bold steps and learn from their mistakes. This can only happen safely in a learning system approach where constantly testing, refining, and improving ideas based on real-time feedback and data keeps the project dynamic and responsive. Strong leadership support is crucial to creating a culture where innovation can thrive.\\n\\n**_Ensuring risks are managed appropriately_**\\n\\nBoards and organisations need to consciously consider their collective appetite for risk aligned to strategic goals with high impact on service delivery and societal benefits and articulate it clearly as part of decision making.\\n\\nThis will reassure stakeholders that risks are being managed responsibly and garner support for innovative projects even those with perceived high risk. If they don’t, it may hamper the ability to innovate successfully while ensuring accountability.\\n\\nHaving a defined risk appetite framework will ensure decisions are made with a clear understanding of risks and benefits, reducing ad hoc or overly cautious approaches and enabling experimentation of new ideas, technologies or approaches without the fear of punitive consequences. Through transparency of decision making as part of governance arrangements, trust in innovation initiatives is encouraged with reduced risk of individual bias.It also helps in deciding where to allocate resources by balancing potential impact against acceptable risks to achieve strategic objectives.  When making decisions on where to invest, higher tolerance areas such as digital transformation can channel investment into novel technologies.\\n\\n**_Building workforce capable of managing risk_**\\n\\nThe best ideas for innovation often come from the frontline, as NHS staff, directly involved in healthcare delivery, are in the best position to identify and solve problems.\\n\\nWe need to fund the changes, not just the tech, ensuring that investment goes into creating environments where creativity flourishes, allowing teams to think outside the box and explore unconventional innovative ideas. By operating with a high degree of autonomy, these teams can take calculated risks and embrace failure as part of the learning process.\\n\\nEquipping our workforce with skills in managing risk along with innovation skills is imperative to this. The Innovation Ecosystem Report stated “ _NHS England, professional bodies and the Royal Colleges should develop capability frameworks for innovation for all staff, clinical leadership and board-level executives and non-executives” as its recommended route to delivery._ Supporting better partnership working between Industry and the NHS is another way to crowd in the vital innovation skills needed.We must also consider how we recognise and reward staff who take calculated risks and drive innovation as champions and support and nurture staff who want to drive change.\\n\\n**_A pro-innovation public_**\\n\\nWe should be visibly championing innovation testing and adoption to all, including the public. A specific recommendation of the Innovation Ecosystem Report was for national clinical leadership to identify 200-300 innovation leaders to act as champions for innovation which could be a great driver for change both locally and nationally. This recommendation included working with patient groups to identify citizen innovation leaders.\\n\\nInvolving patients and the public not just in the development of innovation, but actively seeking to understand their appetite for its implementation in their care, as demonstrated by the deliberation delivered as part of the Secure Data Environments, or more recent work ascertaining Londoners views on the future of Primary Care, is a powerful tool for building clinical confidence and supporting commissioning decisions relating to innovation too.\\n\\nHaving a public hungry for innovation, as well as a workforce, will support our collective appetite for risk and deliver a less paternalistic approach to healthcare delivery._The Health Innovation Network provides this support for local health and care systems, academia and life science partners so please do get in touch if we can help navigate some of these challenges.

As an outcome of that consultation NHS England agreed a number of principles to inform how it would prioritise new investments in specialised services. In our response to the consultation (June 2015) we described further work that we would undertake in 2015/16 to develop a method that could be used by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) when forming recommendations on the relative prioritisation of new investments.\\n\\nNHS England’s public consultation Developing a Method to Assist Investment Decisions in Specialised Commissioning was held between 11 April and 11 May 2016. The consultation guide described a detailed method that it proposed would be applied by CPAG in the 2016/17 commissioning round. A number of questions were asked of respondents.Pre-consultation engagement took place where possible so that stakeholders were fully informed. This included a presentation (and question and answer session) with industry representatives. To support the process of consultation NHS England hosted two webinars which were well attended and we held a stakeholder event attended by 60 people from a range of interests. In total, NHS England received 117 responses through the consultation hub and a further 5 responses through email and post. In terms of “sunshine” / conflict of interest disclosures, one third of respondents had received funding from the pharmaceutical sector, as had two-thirds of the patient charities / voluntary groups who responded\\n\\nThe report of an analysis of consultation responses by the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Administration is included as an Appendix.\\n\\nResponses to the consultation addressed both the immediate process of making relative prioritisation decisions for the 2016/17 year, and also addressed process issues that will be relevant to our decision making for 2017/18 onwards. NHS England wishes to thank everyone who took the time to respond to consultation, which has resulted in a rich source of views and ideas.This document provides NHS England’s response to the feedback received on consultation questions as described in the consultation analysis report.\\n\\nThe analysis of consultation feedback concludes that responses to NHS England’s proposed method for relative prioritisation were divided between those who agreed and disagreed. However, many of the respondents who chose the “disagree” option explained that they were not proposing to delay the process of prioritisation for 2016/17. Rather, they called upon NHS England to adopt the method for 2016/17 on an interim basis and to further develop the method for future years, informed by the learning of this year’s commissioning round. The need for a process to be operational for 2016/17 by June 2016 was acknowledged by respondents so that patients are able to benefit from new interventions as rapidly as possible.\\n\\nThe independent analysis of consultation responses provides an overview of positive comments about the proposed method:\\n\\nThe intent to establish a more pragmatic decision-making framework\\n\\n The desire to improve the consistency and reduce the subjectivity of the approach The acknowledgement that it should help provide evidence to support specialised commissioning of services The recognition of the need for a clear and transparent method for relative prioritisation of treatmentsThe facilitation of discussions about value for money\\n\\nFor 2016/17 we will adopt the proposed method, but recognise the need to develop iteratively the method, including learning from the application of the method for 2017/18.\\n\\nMany helpful and detailed submissions were made about how to develop the method in the future, including calls for clarification on key aspects of the process. In this document we describe how we will further explore the issues that were raised during consultation.\\n\\nSome respondents argued that alternative methods for relative prioritisation are available. Some also suggested that the length of the consultation has been too short to enable alternative methods of prioritisation to be developed for submission to NHS England.\\n\\nThe purpose of this consultation was to seek views on the specific method developed by NHS England over the past year. However, reflecting NHS England’s acknowledgement that development of the method will be iterative, we are keen to work with stakeholders, including a future consideration of alternative methods or elements of a method that stakeholders identify.\\n\\nNHS England’s commitment to a transparent process was welcomed, and respondents were interested in more information on how this will be achieved.Over the past year the transparency of the process for developing clinical commissioning policy propositions has been significantly increased through more focused stakeholder engagement and consultation on the documentation that it is presented to CPAG to support each policy proposition. For 2016/17, once NHS England has made a final decision on which proposals will be funded, we will publish the recommendations that were made by CPAG to NHS England with a summary description of the reasoning for CPAG’s recommendations.\\n\\nIn regard to 2017/18, detailed proposals were made by some respondents about how the transparency of the process overall may be improved, from development of the clinical commissioning propositions through to final decision by NHS England, and we will carefully consider these proposals further.Respondents have also asked for an explanation of how proposals that are not funded for 2016/17 may re-enter the process of relative prioritisation in future years. We need to balance the need for a process that is flexible when this is appropriate, with one that enables NHS England to make decisions that are final when this is appropriate. We will give this further thought for future years, but for proposed investments that are not funded by NHS England in 2016/17 on the grounds of affordability we will ask the relevant National Programme of\\n\\nCare to consider whether the proposed service development should be included in the 2016/17 work programme alongside proposals for new clinical commissioning policies.Views were mixed on this question. Although some respondents were in agreement, some suggested that the proposed method may lead to unpredictable results year to year because of the relative nature of prioritisation and the fact that the budget available for new investments will vary each year. Our view is that the proposed method will increase consistency and predictability in decision making through its focus on sound principles around evidence of effectiveness and value for money. The fact that this is indeed a relative process, and the fact that the available budget may vary each year, do not in themselves support the suggestion of inconsistency and unpredictability, but this is something that we will review over time. Precisely because it is about choosing possible investments within a fixed budget constraint it inevitably operates differently to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-type appraisal processes.\\n\\nIn response to comments that our process of relative prioritisation needs to be aligned with broader strategic objectives, we will consider the report of the Accelerated Access Review (AAR) once it is published. The AAR aims to speed up access to innovative drugs, devices and diagnostics for patients.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.pwc.co.uk/healthcare/pdf/managing-risk-in-nhs-2023.pdf\",\n    \"query\": \"specific financial risks and mitigation strategies NHS\",\n    \"content\": \"In June 2023, NHS England published the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan which sets out an ambitious ongoing programme of strategic workforce planning to 'put staffing on a sustainable footing and improve patient care'. As reflected in PwC’s comments on the NHS Workforce Plan, 'The NHS Workforce Plan sets out a clear roadmap to tackle the critical issues facing healthcare provision. Whilst it is a much-needed step forward, it will require commitment at all levels of the workforce to execute the delivery of the plan.'\\n\\nFrom our analysis of BAFs this year we are continuing to see a number of organisations highlight the risks around recruitment, retention, training, workforce planning, equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI), staff wellbeing, staff engagement, and leadership.\\n\\nEquity is also a factor that requires consideration, as explored in the PwC publication A fairer future: how can the NHS tackle health and social inequities?\\n\\nUnderpinning all of this is the culture of NHS organisations. Organisations are wanting to establish and maintain cultures which promote flexibility, wellbeing, and career development amongst a diverse and inclusive workforce. The current challenges facing the NHS, however, continues to put this at risk.Despite increased funding for the NHS since the pandemic started, long-term financial sustainability is still seen as a key risk for the sector. Looking at some of the other top 10 risks we have continued to see this year it is clear why this is the case.\\n\\nA number of risks, such as increased patient demand, workforce, estates, and IT, all require significant funding to address them. Workforce costs account for around $70%$ of the NHS’s budget, but with significant staff vacancies across the NHS additional costs are going to be incurred by NHS organisations if they are going to successfully fill these vacancies. NHS organisations still operate a number of ageing IT systems, along with relying on paper records in a number of areas. To address these risks, and benefit from the long-term efficiencies, significant investment in IT and digitalisation is required.\\n\\nThe challenging financial environment that NHS organisations are operating within requires significant cost improvement plans to bring predicted expenditure in-line with financial allocations. Increasing emphasis is now placed on NHS organisations to work collectively within their system to manage their financial performance to a break even position which needs the development of system-wide project management offices.Estate costs are also increasing. As part of the 2021/22 Estates Return Information Collection (ERIC) by NHS Digital, estimated costs had increased by $8.8%$ since 2020/21 to £11.1bn annually.\\n\\nOur analysis shows that to continue delivering patient services to the required standard, along with long-term investment to achieve the NHS Long Term Plan, organisations view hitting their control totals (their financial target – either a minimum surplus or maximum deficit they have to meet) as a significant risk.\\n\\nIT infrastructure remains in fourth place this year (increasing from sixth in our 2020/21 report). From our analysis there are two key factors driving this risk. Firstly, the continued increase of cyber security threats which has materialised in a number of sectors since the pandemic started. And secondly, the transformation of IT services that needs to take place for NHS organisations to meet their future strategic ambitions and work in partnership with others.As reported by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), over the past year the cyber security threat to the UK has evolved significantly. The threat from ransomware was ever present – and remains a major challenge to businesses and public services in the UK. This year 18 ransomware incidents required a nationally coordinated response, including an attack on a supplier to NHS 111.\\n\\nOrganisations also need to invest in their IT infrastructure to achieve their long-term strategies, including as part of partnership working (see risk five). The future of health services is going to be reliant on technology and IT systems, with the NHS Long Term Plan citing the need for digitally enabled primary and outpatient care to improve both quality and reduce demand on front line services.\\n\\nData sharing across NHS organisations within the same system will also be vital to facilitate the targeted intervention for improving health inequalities.\\n\\nFollowing several years of locally-led development, recommendations of NHS England and passage of the Health and Care Act (2022), 42 ICSs were established across England on a statutory basis on 1 July 2022.\\n\\nThe purpose of ICSs is to bring partner organisations together to:\\n\\nImprove outcomes in population health\\n\\nand healthcare.Tackle inequalities in outcomes, experience and access.\\n\\nEnhance productivity and value for money. Help the NHS support broader social and economic development.\\n\\nAs a result, organisations need to work together and collaborate – thus moving away from decades of autonomy and competition.\\n\\nProvider collaborations are just one example of how entities are being brought together to revise patient pathways and create more integrated ways of working. Naturally, this has posed a number of challenges at organisation and system level.\\n\\nThe challenges around estates continue to be a by-product of both financial challenges and the impact of COVID-19. NHS Digital reported as part of the 2021/22 ERIC return that backlog maintenance costs, which are a measure of how much money would be needed to restore a building to a certain state, based on a standard risk criterion, has increased by $11%$ on the prior year to £10.2bn. It is worth highlighting that this also does not include planned maintenance work.As outlined in PwC's Journey towards financial sustainability for Integrated Care Systems report, there are a number of factors that should be considered as organisations work together to identify and implement a programme of change, which include understanding the size and key drivers of the system challenge.\\n\\nEstablishing rigorous governance and strong leadership is also essential in order for all health organisations and systems to develop and deliver financial sustainability plans. Strong clinical, operational and financial leadership will play a vital role in achieving overall system sustainability and ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of patients.\\n\\nOur analysis shows that organisations continue to be concerned about their ageing estates, the costs involved in updating them and the competing priorities for funding.\\n\\nThe current status of NHS organisations' estates is interlinked with the patient care risk discussed at the start of this section. Around half of the backlog in estates maintenance is for issues which present a high or significant risk to patients and staff.\\n\\nAgeing estates and an inability to carry out work in a timely manner is increasing the risk to health and safety within organisations.The UK has also been experiencing its highest rates of inflation since 2008 in recent times, having rose by $11.1%$ in the 12 months to October 2022 before reducing to $8.7%$ in the 12 months to May 2023. Capital budgets, which are already under significant pressure, are further squeezed making the delivery of transformational capital investments more challenging.\\n\\nThe UK government’s pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 has itself been hit by inflation causing delays and uncertainty as to whether these developments will materialise in practice.\\n\\nAdding to the complexity of estates backlogs is private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, with organisations reliant on their PFI providers. In October 2018, the government announced it would no longer use the PFI model. Existing PFI contracts remain in place and the earliest ones are now starting to expire. There are currently over 700 PFI contracts with the bulk expiring from 2025.\\n\\nMost PFI contracts result in the assets – whether it’s a hospital building or an IT system – being returned to the authority once the contract ends.PFI assets should be well maintained throughout the contract life and be in a good condition when returned to the authority. However, one of the main risks to value for money in PFI contracts is that they are not, which poses a risk to any public services associated with those assets.\\n\\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) has found that public sector bodies risk underestimating the time, resources and complexity involved in managing the end of PFI contracts, and that there is danger that important infrastructure could return to the public sector in an unsatisfactory condition and services could be disrupted unless a more consistent and strategic approach is taken to ending PFI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinked to patient care, NHS organisations are aware that deterioration in their services is likely to result in regulatory action.\\n\\nAlthough this risk has fallen down the rankings this year, sustainable services are dependent on NHS organisations achieving their long-term strategic objectives and mitigating the other key risks highlighted in our analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of NHS organisations are concerned about their ability to deliver innovation and research-excellence due to the competing time on staff and resources.\\n\\nNHS organisations are highlighting the risk of them achieving their visions and long-term strategic objectives due to the ongoing demand and impact of the pandemic.# Workforce# Financial performance# 4\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>The `strategyunitwm.nhs.uk` PDF (2018) failed to load.\nThe `england.nhs.uk` PDF (2016) \"Developing a method to assist investment decisions in specialised...\" provides a framework for relative prioritisation of investments based on clinical effectiveness, patient benefit, and value for money.

It can be adapted, depending on the needs of individual NHS trusts. The guidance has been developed following consultation with risk experts from different organisations and from institutions that teach or are experts in risk management. It is supported by background guidance along with the findings from workshops and consultations.Risk assessment is a systematic and effective method of identifying risks and determining the most cost-effective means to minimise or remove them. It is an essential part of any risk management programme, and it encompasses the processes of risk analysis and risk evaluation.1,2 The Department of Health (DH) recommends that the Boards of NHS organisations should ensure that the effort and resources that are spent on managing risk are proportionate to the risk itself.3 NHS organisations therefore should have in place efficient assessment processes covering all areas of risk. It is also a legal requirement that all NHS staff actively manage risk.4\\n\\nTo separate those risks that are unacceptable from those that are tolerable, risks should be evaluated in a consistent manner. Risks are usually analysed by combining estimates of consequence (also described as severity or outcome) and likelihood (frequency or probability) in the context of existing control measures.5 In general, the magnitude or rating of a given risk is established using a two-dimensional grid or matrix, with consequence as one axis and likelihood as the other.While preparing these guidelines, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reviewed a variety of risk matrices currently in use in NHS organisations. The aim was to identify or develop a risk assessment matrix that could be recommended for use across the NHS. The review revealed the following properties as being essential for such a risk assessment matrix:\\n\\nIt should be simple to use.\\n\\na variety of roles or professions.\\n\\nhealth and safety, financial risks, and reputation.\\n\\nThis guidance can be used on its own as a tool for introducing risk assessments in an NHS organisation, or for improving consistency or scope of risk assessments already in place in NHS organisations and for training purposes.\\n\\nIt is, however, strongly recommended that where elements of this guidance are to be used as part of an organisation-wide risk assessment system, the guidance is integrated with, or directly referred to within, a Board-approved risk management policy or strategy. In particular, an NHS organisation should use this guidance only within the framework of its strategic risk appetite and risk management decision-making process.\\n\\nAn MS Word version of the model matrix (page 13) is available at: www.npsa.nhs.ukWhat is defined as an adverse event and how many individuals may\\n\\nbe affected?\\n\\nA single risk area may have multiple potential consequences, and these may require separate assessment. It is also important to consider from whose perspective the risk is being assessed (organisation, member of staff, patient) because this may affect the assessment of the risk itself, its consequences and the subsequent action taken.\\n\\nNHS organisations implementing these guidelines may benefit from having more detailed definitions or examples for each consequence score. Table 1b (page 7) shows a number of examples for use a local level to exemplify various levels of consequence under the domain that covers the impact of the risk on the safety of patients, staff or public.†\\n\\nTrusts should consider including more examples in any of the consequence categories if it is felt that extra guidance may be required within the trust’s risk assessment procedures, for training purposes or both.Once a specific area of risk has been assessed and its consequence score agreed, the likelihood of that consequence occurring can be identified by using table 2 below. Note that the table is intended as guidance and trusts are encouraged to populate the table with their own probability and frequency descriptions. As with the assessment of ‘consequence’, the likelihood of a risk occurring is assigned a number from ‘1’ to ‘5’: the higher the number the more likely it is the consequence will occur:\\n\\n1 Rare\\n\\n2 Unlikely\\n\\n3 Possible\\n\\n4 Likely\\n\\n5 Almost certain\\n\\nWhen assessing likelihood, it is important to take into consideration the controls already in place. The likelihood score is a reflection of how likely it is that the adverse consequence described will occur. Likelihood can be scored by considering:\\n\\nfrequency (how many times will the adverse consequence being assessed actually be realised?) or probability (what is the chance the adverse consequence will occur in a given reference period?).\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2 provides definitions of descriptors that can be used to score the likelihood of a risk being realised by assessing frequency.It is possible to use more quantitative descriptions for frequency by considering how often the adverse consequence being assessed will be realised. For example, when assessing the risk of staff shortages on a ward, the likelihood of it occurring could be assessed as expected to occur daily or even weekly depending on staffing levels. However, if staff shortages are unlikely it could be graded as expected to occur annually. A simple set of time-framed definitions for frequency is shown above in table 3.\\n\\nHowever, frequency is not a useful way of scoring certain risks, especially those associated with the success of time-limited or one-off projects such as a new IT system that is being delivered as part of a three-year programme or business objectives. For these kinds of risks, the likelihood score cannot be based on how often the consequence will materialise. Instead, it must be based on the probability that it will occur at all in a given time period. In other words, a three-year IT project cannot be expected to fail ‘once a month’, and the likelihood score will need to be assessed on the probability of adverse consequences occurring within the project’s time frame.With regard to achieving a national target, the risk of missing the target will be based on the time left during which the target is measured. A trust might have assessed the probability of missing a key target as being quite high at the beginning of the year, but nine months later, if all the control measures have been effective, there is a much reduced probability of the target not being met.\\n\\nThis is why specific ‘probability’ scores have been developed for projects and business objectives (see table 4, below). Essentially, likelihood scores based on probability have been developed from project risk assessment tools from across industry.1 The vast majority of these agree that any project which is more likely to fail than succeed (that is, the chance of failing is greater than 50 per cent) should be assigned a score of 5.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4 can be used to assign a probability score for risks relating to time-limited or one-off projects or business objectives. If it is not possible to determine a numerical probability, the probability descriptions can be used to determine the most appropriate score.\\n\\n1 Define the risk(s) explicitly in terms of the adverse consequence(s) that might arise from the risk.2 Use table 1a to determine the consequence score(s) (C) for the potential adverse outcome(s) relevant to the risk being evaluated.\\n\\n3 Use table 2 to determine the likelihood score(s) (L) for those adverse outcomes. If possible, score the likelihood by assigning a predicted frequency of occurrence of the adverse outcome. If this is not possible, assign a probability to the adverse outcome occurring within a given time frame, such as the lifetime of a project or a patient care episode. If a numerical probability cannot be determined, use the probability descriptions to determine the most appropriate score.\\n\\n4 Calculate the risk score by multiplying the consequence by the likelihood: C (consequence) $\\\\\\\\times\\\\\\\\textsf{L}$ (likelihood) $={\\\\\\\\mathsf{R}}$ (risk score)\\n\\nThe risk matrix in table 5 shows both numerical scoring and colour bandings. A trust’s risk management policy or strategy should be used to identify the level at which the risk will be managed in the trust, assign priorities for remedial action, and determine whether risks are to be accepted, on the basis of the colour bandings and/or risk score.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor grading risk, the scores obtained from the risk matrix are assigned\\n\\ngradesas follows:\\n\\n1–3 Low risk\\n\\n4–6 Moderate risk\\n\\n8–12 High risk\\n\\n15–25 Extreme risk\\n\\nThis model risk matrix has the following advantages:\\n\\nNHS trusts are familiar with a five by five matrix. • It is simple yet flexible, and therefore lends itself to adaptability. It is based on simple mathematical formulae and is ideal for use in spreadsheets. Equal weighting of consequence and likelihood prevents disproportionate effort directed at highly unlikely but high consequence risks. This should clearly illustrate the effectiveness of risk treatment. There are four colour bandings for categorising risk, which may be useful for some trusts. Even if the boundaries of risk categorisation are changed, trusts will still be able to compare ‘scores’ to monitor whether risks are being evaluated in a similar manner.\\n\\nOne of the features of the risk scoring system described here is that it includes a mechanism for directly scoring the consequence of an adverse event. When assessing risks, the consequence score is used to grade the consequence of events that might occur because of the risk in question. However, consequence scores can directly be used to grade incidents. It makes sense for a trust to use the same definitions, terminology and grading systems for both potential and actual incidents.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/An_exemplar_operational_risk_management_strategy.pdf\",\n    \"query\": \"NHS operational risk management strategy quantification prioritization\",\n    \"content\": \"$\\\\\\\\circledcirc$ Crown copyright 1997.

It describes how to identify and quantify risks of all types, clinical and non-clinical, and assesses priorities for action. It also emphasises the need for monitoring and auditing to ensure cost-effective solutions.\\n\\nOn behalf of the Institute of Risk Management, I am pleased to recommend this contribution to the developing role of risk management in the NHS.\\n\\nAndrew L S Mills FCII, FIRM\\n\\nGovernor\\n\\nChair of Education and Training CommitteeThe Institute of Risk Management\\n\\nThere are significant opportunities for achieving improved quality of care, major costs savings, improved public perception and a reduction in clinical negligence claims by having the correct risk management strategy and implementing “best risk management practice” throughout NHS trusts.\\n\\nA sound risk management strategy is vital if trust chief executives/ boards are to reap the full benefits of risk management and avoid the dangers of operational risks. This exemplar provides an example of how all trust risks can be integrated, and a trust’s operational risk management strategy produced.\\n\\nThe key elements of the operational risk management strategy are:\\n\\na. the preparation of a risk management plan which has identified:\\n\\n(i) the trust’s existing and future risks;\\n\\n(ii) risk reduction measures – current and future options;\\n\\n(iii) a system for monitoring effectiveness and performance;\\n\\n(iv) plans to improve key risk indicators;\\n\\nb. the development of the strategy by the process of:\\n\\n(i) risk analysis;\\n\\n(ii) setting risk targets;\\n\\n(iii) developing risk control options;\\n\\n(iv) evaluating risk control strategies.\\n\\nBy drawing up a risk management strategy and implementing best risk management practice, the following goals can be achieved:\\n\\nenhanced quality of care; protection against criminal prosecution;• financial savings from reduced risk, which includes reduction in claims against the trust and optimisation of insurance premium expenditure; cost-efficient risk reduction;\\n\\n• improved public image;\\n\\n• improved staff morale and productivity.\\n\\nThe process provides, in addition to the benefits outlined, a basis for systematic decision-making and a clear hierarchy of risks.\\n\\nThis document outlines the reasons for the necessity of a sound operational risk management strategy; it gives an overview of the objectives of a risk strategy and explains the stages in the process. The appendices contain an exemplar strategy compiled for a hypothetical trust, and an introduction to the principles and application of frequency/consequence curves, which are part of the risk analysis process.\\n\\nNHS Estates would like to thank all those organisations who contributed comments to this document.

It is vital that the risks associated with these changes and the ongoing provision of healthcare are effectively managed.\\n\\n1.3 A risk management strategy has a key role to play in providing the strategic context within which detailed capital and revenue investment plans and business cases can be developed. A risk management strategy will provide the framework in which new and sometimes radical investment proposals can be developed and evaluated. This should ensure that such investment is effective in delivering improved health outcomes.1.4 Since the loss of Crown immunity between 1987 and 1991, trusts have been responsible for their own liabilities. In cases of non-compliance with statutory requirements, chief executives and managers can be criminally prosecuted and, if the offence is considered serious enough by the courts, a fine and/or imprisonment can be imposed. The number of statutory regulations that a trust must comply with is enormous, ranging from health and safety legislation and fire safety regulations to requirements for the safe storage and disposal of clinical waste. A risk management strategy is essential to place statutory compliance risks in an overall risk context.\\n\\n1.5 NHS trusts are operating in an increasingly litigious society. Claims for clinical negligence and staff injury can run into hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds, with potentially dire financial consequences for the trust concerned. Since 1 April 1995 trusts have been able to join the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST), where contributions are pooled to cover expensive claims. Insurance should be seen as a last resort for risk transfer, after all other avenues have been explored. The management of such risks should still form an integral part of a trust risk strategy.1.6 The effects of the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 mean that trusts must also respond to the demands of a new healthcare system. Trusts must make effective use of their limited resources if they are to be successful. Unmanaged risk costs unbudgeted money. Eliminating or reducing exposure to unidentified/unwanted/unacceptable risk, and making appropriate provision for those risks that remain, will ensure that the financial impact of purchaser decisions can be absorbed. The risk management strategy is crucial in dealing with low frequency/high consequence financial risks.\\n\\n1.7 The risk management strategy should be reviewed regularly as part of the trust’s business planning cycle. This will ensure that risks resulting from changes in the trust and its annual business plan are managed adequately.\\n\\n2.1 An operational risk management strategy can be defined as:\\n\\n“a plan for identifying, reducing and managing risk in an optimum way in relation to a trust’s service and business needs”.\\n\\n2.2 The objective is to provide a concise document which clearly identifies the strategic-level changes that are needed to manage key risk indicators, thus enabling the trust’s board to monitor performance and so continue to deliver healthcare to the satisfaction of patients and purchasers.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"url\": \"https://www.niauditoffice.gov.uk/publications/html-document/innovation-and-risk-management-good-practice-guide\",\n    \"query\": \"mitigation strategies for NHS innovation risks and risk appetite\",\n    \"content\": \"4\\\\. There is increasing demand for better, more responsive services. In the context of changing landscapes and fiscal pressures, it is essential that public bodies identify new ways of operating and delivering services. The United Kingdom (UK) is one of forty countries that adopted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Declaration on Public Sector Innovation(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab in 2019. It recognises the shared understanding among governments about the role of innovation in meeting challenges, and constitutes a concrete commitment to support, improve and expand public sector innovation. It is based on five principles and associated actions that public sector organisations can use to inform and enhance innovation and its management:\\n\\n5\\\\. At the time of this guide, there is no specific government wide plan designed to support the implementation of the OECD declaration in Northern Ireland. **Appendix One** provides details on how the Republic of Ireland is working to promote, develop and embed a culture of innovation throughout its public sector. We found this to be an interesting example which demonstrates a commitment to innovating, including an overarching Innovation Strategy, supported by guidance and toolkits to assist public bodies.6\\\\. Beyond Ideas(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab noted that in the public sector good ideas are getting stuck and staying small, while legacy systems, old policies and procedures continue to be used despite poor or weak evidence of their effectiveness. More needs to be done to encourage and embed innovation within public bodies and drive continuous improvement in government services.\\n\\n7\\\\. Traditionally, public sector bodies display many of the characteristics associated with a risk averse culture and there are inevitably risks associated with innovation. There is often a perception that governance and accountability structures deter innovative and new approaches. However, as auditors we recognise that well-managed risk taking is a necessary feature of most types of innovation. When properly managed, taking risks through challenging the status quo and innovating can lead to improved value for money and better outcomes.8\\\\. There were positives and opportunities that emerged in the midst of the difficulties and challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. These include a willingness to work in new and innovative ways, harnessing technologies and using them to best advantage to ensure business continuity, and to find more efficient ways of working. For example, in the health sector, innovative interventions were developed at pace to lessen the impact of the virus, and new ways of continuing to deliver existing services during the pandemic were also developed. Ensuring that the public sector takes the learning from those innovative and creative ways of working and continues to build on them is crucial for continuous improvement.\\n\\n9\\\\. The guide is structured as follows:\\n\\n10\\\\. **Figure 2** visually summarises how the parts of this guide come together to form our **Framework for Innovation and Risk Management in the public sector**. We drew on the work of organisations such as the OECD and the Innovation Lab, and the work of other public audit agencies, to develop this Framework.\\n\\nImage placeholder Figure\\\\_21.1 In the private sector risks are seen in terms of the possible impact on profitability and shareholder value. The risk of not innovating is well understood and the consequences of failure are reduced profitability. In the public sector, however, risk is often considered in terms of the potential damage to an organisation’s reputation and failure to achieve public policy objectives. The consequences of failure may mean the quality of public services and individuals’ lives could be adversely affected. Innovation is not always seen as fundamental to the achievement of objectives.\\n\\n1.2 **Figure 3** shows a number of commonly cited enablers of innovation and barriers to innovation. It is interesting to note that many of the barriers also feature as enablers. Beyond Ideas(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab refers to the “innovation equation” which highlights the need to understand both sides of the equation i.e. both the barriers and the enablers; and then find a way to tip the balance in favour of the enablers to deliver change.\\n\\n**Figure 3: The Innovation Equation: Barriers and Enablers**\\n\\n**Enablers:**\\n\\n**Barriers:**1.3 We surveyed 111 public sector organisations to help us gain a better insight into the perceptions and experiences of innovation within public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. Over 50 per cent responded and shared their views on several matters including:\\n\\nWe also asked respondents to share examples of innovations within their organisations and we have included a small number of these as case studies in **Part Four** and **Appendix Three**.\\n\\n**Key message**\\n\\n**The main barriers to innovation, identified by Northern Ireland public sector organisations were:**\\n\\n**Key message**\\n\\n**The main enablers of innovation, identified by Northern Ireland public sector organisations were:**\\n\\n**Key message**\\n\\n**The key themes arising in the responses on key actions or messages that could further embed innovation within the public sector were:**2.1 As shown in **Figure 3** many of the barriers to innovation can also be enablers of innovation and vice versa. If the public sector is to narrow the ‘Innovation Gap’ between ideas and their successful implementation as innovations, then it needs to understand the conditions that can enable innovation. **Figure 4** expands on the key enablers of innovation shown in our Framework at **Figure 2**. Each enabler is discussed in more detail in this part of the guide.\\n\\nImage placeholder Figure\\\\_4\\n\\n2.2 Research indicates that leadership is key to enabling innovation. Beyond Ideas(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab identified eight ideas as a stimulus for leaders to unlock innovation in the public sector and includes a Leaders Innovation checklist. The importance of leadership in enabling innovation was the most frequently cited enabler of innovation in the responses to our survey of public sector organisations. The strategic vision and direction of leaders was also one of the key themes arising in responses on actions or messages that could further embed innovation within the public sector. So, what can leaders do to turn barriers into enablers and encourage and embed a culture of innovation throughout the public sector?**Key message**\\n\\n**Leaders have a hugely important role in enabling and embedding innovation. Through their behaviours, and the policies and procedures put in place, leaders can create the conditions that either enable or hinder innovation.**\\n\\n2.3 Traditionally public sector bodies display many of the characteristics associated with a risk averse culture. The risk of failure, and subsequently being held to account, can influence, or be influenced by, risk appetite. However, best practice guidance on risk management emphasises that the consequences of risk can be positive or negative. Well-managed risk taking can produce benefits for the organisation in terms of opportunities, but equally risk can present threats that ultimately may impact on an organisation’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. Risk management is an important aspect of good governance and innovation. It is a useful tool in contributing to the achievement of outcomes and ensuring that public bodies meet their objectives.2.4 Strong leadership is essential in embedding an organisational risk management culture and influencing attitude to risk throughout the organisation. Risk management continues to be a highly topical issue for all government departments and practical guidance on the concept of risk management is provided in HM Treasury’s Orange Book: Management of Risk – Principles and Concepts(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab. Most public sector organisations have well established risk management frameworks ensuring arrangements are in place to identify and analyse risks in a systematic way. Therefore, properly managed, calculated risk taking should already be a feature of all organisations and projects, and the implementation of risk management procedures should already form a necessary part of decision making processes. What may differ with innovation is the complexity of identifying and managing the risks.\\n\\n**Key message**\\n\\n**It is worth remembering that it is not possible to eliminate risk; there will always be a level of residual risk that cannot be addressed. However, it can be properly managed and mitigated.**2.5 It is right that there are different risk appetites in different environments. There are some areas of the public sector where it is right to tolerate only a small risk profile, but there are other areas where there is a need to embrace risk. Properly managing risk is fundamental to delivering any level of change or transformation.\\n\\n2.6 There is often a perception that governance and accountability structures deter innovative and new approaches. That should not be the case. Leaders should expect to be held to account - it is an integral part of the governance and accountability process in the public sector. Finding innovative ways to deliver improved public services at less cost is essential. Leaders should not fear being held to account when decisions have been made on the basis of robust evidence and change has been properly supported and enabled through effective risk management. The structure of an organisation’s risk management function will vary according to its size, nature, and resource constraints. Equally, the risk management and governance structures put in place to manage innovations, will vary according to the complexity of the innovation and the assessment of risk associated with it. Being fit for purpose is key.2.7 Effective leadership is crucial to innovation and enabling a culture that supports innovation – a risk averse or indeed a blame culture will not foster innovation. Rather than focusing on the risk of a project failing, there is just as much need to consider the risk of doing nothing. Leadership can influence change in risk averse attitudes and help to create and embed a culture of innovation, learning and creativity, which is underpinned by appropriate risk management processes and an acceptance that some innovations won’t work - but there will still be important lessons to learn.\"\n  }\n]"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Starting to generate the final answer. Please wait a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is actively seeking to accelerate the uptake of innovative medical technologies (MedTech) to improve patient care and achieve cost savings. This is evidenced by initiatives like the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM), launched in April 2021, which aims to ensure faster and more equitable access to selected clinically effective and cost-saving medical devices, diagnostics, and digital products. These technologies are typically funded by commissioners from existing allocations, as they are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and are expected to provide a return on investment within three years.\n\nInnovation within the NHS operates within a complex ecosystem involving research, funding, people, and infrastructure. While there is a strong history of developing innovations in the UK, the adoption and spread within the NHS have been identified as areas needing improvement. This is partly due to factors such as disjointed policy, regulatory hurdles, a risk-averse culture, and challenges in establishing partnerships between the NHS, academia, and industry.\n\nTo address these challenges and effectively manage the inherent risks associated with funding and implementing healthcare innovations, a structured risk assessment framework is essential. This framework should be tailored to the specific context of NHS UK government funding schemes for MedTech innovation, considering the unique financial, regulatory, operational, and strategic risk factors involved.\n\n## Quantitative Risk Evaluation Framework for NHS Funding Investments in MedTech Innovation\n\nA quantitative risk evaluation framework provides a systematic and objective method for assessing the potential risks associated with NHS funding investments in MedTech innovation. This approach involves identifying potential risks, analyzing their likelihood and impact, and assigning numerical scores to quantify the overall risk level. This allows for a more transparent and consistent evaluation of different investment proposals and helps prioritize mitigation strategies.\n\nThe core components of such a framework include:\n\n1.  **Identification of Key Risk Categories:** Defining the broad areas where risks are likely to arise in the context of funding MedTech innovation within the NHS.\n2.  **Development of Risk Scoring Methodology:** Establishing scales for assessing the probability (likelihood) and impact (consequence) of identified risks, and a method for combining these scores to determine an overall risk rating.\n3.  **Risk Assessment Matrix:** A visual tool to plot risks based on their likelihood and impact scores, allowing for easy categorization and prioritization.\n4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** Outlining actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of high-priority risks.\n\n### Key Risk Categories for NHS UK Government Funding Schemes for MedTech Innovation\n\nBased on the context of NHS innovation funding and the challenges identified, key risk categories specific to MedTech innovation funding schemes can be identified:\n\n*   **Financial Risk:** Risks related to the financial viability and sustainability of the innovation and its implementation within the NHS.\n*   **Regulatory Risk:** Risks associated with navigating the regulatory landscape for medical devices and ensuring compliance.\n*   **Operational Risk:** Risks related to the practical implementation and integration of the innovation within existing NHS workflows and infrastructure.\n*   **Strategic Risk:** Risks concerning the alignment of the innovation with broader NHS strategic objectives and the potential for unintended consequences.\n\n### Risk Scoring Methodology: Probability and Impact Scales\n\nTo quantify risks, a scoring methodology is needed for both the likelihood of a risk occurring and the potential impact if it does occur. A common approach, adapted from general risk management principles used in the NHS, involves using a numerical scale (e.g., 1 to 5) for both probability and impact.\n\n**Probability Scale:**\n\n| Score | Descriptor      | Description                                     |\n| :---- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |\n| 1     | Rare            | May occur only in exceptional circumstances     |\n| 2     | Unlikely        | Could occur at some time                        |\n| 3     | Possible        | Might occur at some time                        |\n| 4     | Likely          | Will probably occur in most circumstances       |\n| 5     | Almost Certain  | Is expected to occur in most circumstances      |\n\n*Based on principles from NHS risk management guidance.*\n\n**Impact Scale:**\n\n| Score | Descriptor       | Description (Examples relevant to MedTech Innovation)                                                                 |\n| :---- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1     | Insignificant    | Minimal impact on finances, operations, regulation, or strategy; easily absorbed.                                     |\n| 2     | Minor            | Limited financial loss, minor disruption to operations, small regulatory hurdle, slight deviation from strategy.        |\n| 3     | Moderate         | Moderate financial impact, noticeable disruption to operations, moderate regulatory challenge, moderate strategic misalignment. |\n| 4     | Major            | Significant financial loss, major disruption to operations, significant regulatory barrier, major strategic conflict.     |\n| 5     | Catastrophic     | Severe financial impact (e.g., bankruptcy), complete operational failure, inability to gain regulatory approval, fundamental strategic failure. |\n\n*Adapted for MedTech innovation context.*\n\n**Risk Score Calculation:**\n\nThe overall risk score can be calculated by multiplying the probability score by the impact score:\n\nRisk Score = Probability Score × Impact Score\n\nThis results in a range of possible risk scores (e.g., 1 to 25 for a 5x5 matrix).\n\n**Risk Grading:**\n\nThese numerical risk scores can then be categorized into risk grades to prioritize attention and mitigation efforts. A common grading system is:\n\n*   **Low Risk:** 1-3\n*   **Moderate Risk:** 4-6\n*   **High Risk:** 8-12\n*   **Extreme Risk:** 15-25\n\n*Based on principles from NHS risk management guidance.*\n\n### Risk Assessment Matrix\n\nA risk assessment matrix visually represents the relationship between likelihood and impact, allowing for a quick understanding of the risk profile of different innovations. Risks falling into the \"High\" or \"Extreme\" categories typically require immediate attention and dedicated mitigation strategies.\n\n| Impact          | Rare (1)   | Unlikely (2)   | Possible (3)   | Likely (4)   | Almost Certain (5) |\n| :-------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----------- | :----------------- |\n| Catastrophic (5)| 5 (Low)    | 10 (High)      | 15 (Extreme)   | 20 (Extreme) | 25 (Extreme)       |\n| Major (4)       | 4 (Moderate)| 8 (High)       | 12 (High)      | 16 (Extreme) | 20 (Extreme)       |\n| Moderate (3)    | 3 (Low)    | 6 (Moderate)   | 9 (High)       | 12 (High)    | 15 (Extreme)       |\n| Minor (2)       | 2 (Low)    | 4 (Moderate)   | 6 (Moderate)   | 8 (High)     | 10 (High)          |\n| Insignificant (1)| 1 (Low)    | 2 (Low)        | 3 (Low)        | 4 (Moderate) | 5 (Low)            |\n\n*Example Risk Assessment Matrix for NHS MedTech Funding*\n\n### Mitigation Strategies for High-Priority Risks\n\nFor risks identified as \"High\" or \"Extreme,\" specific mitigation strategies should be developed and implemented. These strategies aim to either reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring or minimize its impact if it does. Here are examples of mitigation strategies for high-priority risks within each category:\n\n**Financial Risk:**\n\n*   **Risk:** Innovation proves not to be cost-saving or cost-effective in a real-world NHS setting.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   Require robust health economic evaluations based on real-world data.\n    *   Implement phased rollouts with clear evaluation milestones before wider adoption.\n    *   Negotiate outcome-based payment models with innovators.\n    *   Ensure clear funding streams and budget allocation for the innovation's lifecycle.\n\n**Regulatory Risk:**\n\n*   **Risk:** Innovation fails to meet necessary regulatory standards or experiences significant delays in approval.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   Engage early and consistently with regulatory bodies (e.g., MHRA) during the development and evaluation phases.\n    *   Provide clear guidance and support to innovators on regulatory requirements for medical devices in the UK.\n    *   Prioritize innovations with a clear regulatory pathway or existing certifications where possible.\n    *   Establish clear processes for post-market surveillance and reporting of adverse events.\n\n**Operational Risk:**\n\n*   **Risk:** Innovation is difficult to integrate into existing NHS IT systems, workflows, or requires significant staff training and capacity.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   Involve frontline staff and relevant departments (e.g., IT, clinical teams) in the evaluation and implementation planning.\n    *   Assess the digital maturity and infrastructure readiness of implementing sites.\n    *   Develop comprehensive training programs and provide ongoing support for staff.\n    *   Pilot the innovation in a controlled environment to identify and address operational challenges before wider rollout.\n    *   Ensure adequate workforce capacity is available to support the implementation and ongoing use of the innovation.\n\n**Strategic Risk:**\n\n*   **Risk:** Innovation does not align with NHS strategic priorities or creates unintended negative consequences for other services or patient groups.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   Clearly define and communicate national and local innovation priorities to guide investment decisions.\n    *   Conduct thorough assessments of the innovation's potential impact on existing pathways and services.\n    *   Engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including patients and the public, to understand potential benefits and risks.\n    *   Establish mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the strategic impact of adopted innovations over time.\n\nBy implementing a structured quantitative risk evaluation framework, the NHS can enhance its ability to make informed decisions about funding MedTech innovation, manage potential challenges proactively, and ultimately accelerate the adoption of technologies that deliver real value for patients and the health service. This approach, combined with a willingness to embrace a managed level of risk in pursuit of innovation, is crucial for the NHS to meet rising demand and achieve its strategic objectives.", "tool_calls": null}]
