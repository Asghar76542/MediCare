### NHS UK Government Funding Schemes and Investment Opportunities

Several initiatives and funding streams are available to accelerate the adoption and scaling of healthcare innovations within the NHS:

*   **NHS Innovation Service:** This free online platform acts as a gateway for health innovators, connecting them with relevant organizations that can provide tailored support, including guidance from Health Innovation Networks, NICE, MHRA, NIHR, and NHS Supply Chain. It also provides information on funding opportunities, awards, and competitions.
*   **Health Innovation Networks (formerly Academic Health Science Networks - AHSNs):** These networks operate across England, embedded in local health and research ecosystems. They partner with healthcare networks and businesses to support the spread of innovation within the NHS. Their support includes guidance on value propositions, evidence base development, proof-of-concept prototyping, navigating the health and care sector, developing value propositions for market readiness, impact modelling, health economics, and brokering connections with experts. They also support real-world evaluations, roll-out, and adoption.
*   **SBRI Healthcare (Small Business Research Initiative):** This program releases regular funding competitions in partnership with organizations like the Health Innovation Network. SBRI Healthcare awards aim to help the NHS develop new technologies and solutions for significant healthcare challenges. Recent examples include funding for work-related digital innovations for individuals with poor mental health and innovations supporting women's health.
*   **NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA):** An NHS England initiative delivered in partnership with Health Innovation Networks, the NIA accelerates the uptake of high-impact innovations for the benefit of patients, the population, and NHS staff. It provides real-time insights on spread to inform national strategy. The NIA invites applications from exceptional individuals representing innovations that meet a real need through an annual international call. Successful applicants receive bespoke support, including mentorship, links with Health Innovation Networks and other stakeholders, peer-to-peer learning, a dedicated learning program, and a bursary. Since 2015, the NIA has supported over 100 Fellows to scale solutions across the health and care system.
*   **Government Investment in Innovative Technology:** The UK government has made targeted investments to accelerate the adoption of innovative technology. For example, in October 2023, £30 million was allocated for Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) to roll out innovative technology, including virtual wards and wearable devices, to help cut waiting lists and improve care. This builds on previous initiatives like the £21 million Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostics fund.

### Key Financial Metrics and ROI Potential

While specific financial metrics and ROI vary depending on the innovation and the scale of adoption, the provided information highlights the potential for significant returns:

*   **Cost Savings:** Innovations supported by the NHS Innovation Accelerator have demonstrated the potential to generate significant savings for the health and social care system. Examples include:
    *   The Low Carb Program, a digital platform for type 2 diabetes, demonstrated potential net savings over 5 years ranging from £509,435 to £673,108 for a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with 3,000 licenses, resulting in an ROI of between 2.38.
    *   The Feebris AI-guided virtual care platform demonstrated substantial savings of £500,000 per 1,000 patients over one year in North-East London, primarily from reductions in avoidable deterioration, A&E visits, and hospital admissions. If scaled across all care home residents in the UK, Feebris could potentially generate over £200 million in savings per year.
*   **Increased Efficiency and Productivity:** Many innovations aim to improve efficiency, achieve similar outcomes with fewer resources, and reduce demand on the health and social care system. This can lead to cost savings and increased productivity.
*   **Attracting Further Investment:** Participation in programs like the NIA can help innovators secure additional investment. The first cohort of NIA Fellows secured over £28.4 million in additional investment.

It is important to note that while many innovations show potential for cost savings, quantifying the exact return on investment can be challenging due to factors such as uncertainty about input costs, the need for assumptions about the attribution of impacts, and variations in implementation environments. However, the evidence suggests that the value of benefits from successful innovations can exceed the costs of the programs supporting them.
